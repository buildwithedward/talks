"Menopause: Physiology, definitions, and symptoms.","The menopause transition is usually a gradual process occurring over many years, caused by the cessation of ovarian reproductive function, resulting in the end of menstrual bleeding. In the peri-menopause, ovarian function and therefore the production of the hormones oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone can fluctuate greatly, leading to a wide variety of symptoms, affecting multiple organ systems. Menopause and the management of its associated symptoms can be very challenging for patients and clinicians alike and can negatively impact quality of life. The management options include lifestyle adjustment, talking therapies, dietary supplements as well as prescribed medications, including hormone replacement therapy. The UK's average life expectancy for women is approximately 81 years. Therefore, women will now live up to a third of their life being either peri- or postmenopausal. Thus, understanding and treating, where possible, the symptoms of menopause is essential to reduce the burden associated with this physiological state.",2023,12,21
The paradoxical role of zinc on microglia.,"Zinc is an essential trace element for humans, and its homeostasis is essential for the health of the central nervous system. Microglia, the resident immune cells in the central nervous system, play the roles of sustaining, nourishing, and immune surveillance. Microglia are sensitive to microenvironment changes and are easily activated to M1 phenotype to enhance disease progression or the M2 phenotype to improve peripheral nerves injury repair. Zinc is requisite for microglial activation, However, the cytotoxicity outcome of zinc against microglia, the activated microglia phenotype, and activated microglia function are ambiguous. Herein, we have reviewed the neurological function of zinc and microglia, particularly the ambiguous role of zinc on microglia. We also pay attention to the role of zinc homeostasis on microglial function within the central nervous system disease. Finally, we observe the relationship between zinc and microglia, attempting to design new therapeutic measures against major nervous system disorders.",2023,12,28
HIV-1 subtypes and latent reservoirs.,"We explore the current status of research on HIV-1 subtype-specific variations and their impact on HIV-1 latency. We also briefly address the controversy surrounding the decision-making process governing the ON/OFF states of HIV-1 transcription, specifically focusing on the regulatory elements, the long terminal repeat (LTR), and Tat. Understanding the decision-making process is crucial for developing effective intervention strategies, such as the 'shock-and-kill' approach, to reactivate latent HIV-1.",2023,12,12
Insights from the hereditary endocrine clinic.,"For nearly 25 years we participated in a clinic consisting of Geneticists, Endocrinologists and Endocrine Surgeons providing multidisciplinary care to patients and families affected with rare hereditary endocrine tumor syndromes. In this brief commentary we reflect on the evolution and successes of the clinic and recognize the foresight, leadership, support and academic rigor of our colleague Dr. Janice Pasieka in ensuring a world class experience for patients and team members over the past quarter century.",2023,12,27
Can nutrients act as signals under abiotic stress?,"Plant cells are in constant communication to coordinate development processes and environmental reactions. Under stressful conditions, such communication allows the plant cells to adjust their activities and development. This is due to intercellular signaling events which involve several components. In plant development, cell-to-cell signaling is ensured by mobile signals hormones, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), nitric oxide (NO), or hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), as well as several transcription factors and small RNAs. Mineral nutrients, including macro and microelements, are determinant factors for plant growth and development and are, currently, recognized as potential signal molecules. This review aims to highlight the role of nutrients, particularly calcium, potassium, magnesium, nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron as signaling components with special attention to the mechanism of response against stress conditions.",2023,12,29
Acupressure for depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Depression is a common mental disorder caused by the interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors. Treatments include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and other therapies, but they have limitations. Particularly, the COVID-19 pandemic may have a negative impact on depressed people. Thus, developing more potential treatments for depression has currently been an urgent challenge. A growing number of studies have found that acupressure is effective in relieving the symptoms of depression. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupressure in people with depression. English (PubMed, CENTRAL, EMBASE, APA PsycINFO, and CINAHL) and Chinese databases (CBM, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP), ClinicalTrials.gov and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on patients diagnosed with depression from study inception until March 31, 2023. Studies that compared acupressure with sham acupressure, conventional treatments (i.e., medication, usual care, etc.), and acupressure as an adjunct to conventional treatment for depression were included. The primary outcome was depression level measured using the Hamilton Depression Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, or Geriatric Depression Scale. A total of 19 RCTs involving 1686 participants were included. The pooled results showed that acupressure exhibited a significant beneficial effect on reducing the severity of depression compared with sham acupressure and served as an adjunct to conventional treatment, although the evidence level was moderate. Thus, acupressure may be a potential treatment for depression.",2023,12,23
Plasmodium falciparum topoisomerases: Emerging targets for anti-malarial therapy.,"Different metabolic pathways like DNA replication, transcription, and recombination generate topological constrains in the genome. These topological constraints are resolved by essential molecular machines known as topoisomerases. To bring changes in DNA topology, the topoisomerases create a single or double-stranded nick in the template DNA, hold the nicked ends to let the tangled DNA pass through, and finally re-ligate the breaks. The DNA nicking and re-ligation activities as well as ATPase activities (when present) in topoisomerases are subjected to inhibition by several anticancer and antibacterial drugs, thus establishing these enzymes as successful targets in anticancer and antibacterial therapies. The anti-topoisomerase drugs interfere with the functioning of these enzymes and result in the accumulation of DNA tangles or lethal genomic breaks, thereby promoting host cell (or organism) death. The potential of topoisomerases in the human malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum in antimalarial drug development has received little attention so far. Interestingly, the parasite genome encodes orthologs of topoisomerases found in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and archaea, thus, providing an enormous opportunity for investigating these enzymes for antimalarial therapeutics. This review focuses on the features of Plasmodium falciparum topoisomerases (PfTopos) with respect to their closer counterparts in other organisms. We will discuss overall advances and basic challenges with topoisomerase research in Plasmodium falciparum and our attempts to understand the interaction of PfTopos with classical and new-generation topoisomerase inhibitors using in silico molecular docking approach. The recent episodes of parasite resistance against artemisinin, the only effective antimalarial drug at present, further highlight the significance of investigating new drug targets including topoisomerases in antimalarial therapeutics.",2023,12,16
Systemic treatments in pancreatic cancer: Taiwan pancreas society recommendation.,"Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Over the past decade, significant therapeutic advancements have improved the survival rates of patients with pancreatic cancer. One of the primary factors contributing to these positive outcomes is the evolution of chemotherapy, from monotherapy to doublet or triplet regimens, and the integration of multimodal approaches. Additionally, targeted agents tailored to patients with specific genetic alterations and the development of cell therapies show promise in benefiting certain subpopulations. This article focuses on examining pivotal studies that explore the role of chemotherapy in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, maintenance, and salvage settings; highlights interesting findings related to cell therapy; and provides an overview of ongoing trials concerning metastatic settings. This review primarily aimed to offer recommendations based on therapeutic evidence, recent advancements in new treatment combinations, and the most innovative approaches. A unique aspect of this review is the inclusion of published papers on clinical trials and real-world data in Taiwan, thus adding a valuable perspective to the overall analysis.",2023,12,31
DYSREGULATED LEUKOTRIENE METABOLISM IN COVID-19 PATIENTS.,"The aim of this study was to examine leukotriene metabolism in COVID-19. A total of 180 people were included in the study. Of these, 60 were healthy controls, 60 were patients who needed intensive care unit (ICU), and 60 were patients who did not need intensive care (non-ICU). Serum levels of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), 5-LO activating protein (ALOX5AP) and cysteinyl leukotriene (CYSLT) were measured and mRNA expressions of 5-LO, ALOX5AP and cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CYSLTR1) were investigated. As compared to the control group, both non-ICU and ICU groups had lower levels of 5-LO and mRNA expression. ICU patients had lower levels of 5-LO and mRNA expression compared with non-ICU patients. The expression of CYSLTR1 mRNA was higher in patients compared to healthy controls. CYSLTR1 mRNA expression was found to be higher in ICU group than in non-ICU group. CYSLT levels were higher in the control group compared to both non-ICU and ICU patients. Due to the higher expressions of CYSLTR1 in patients than control group, selective leukotriene receptor blockers can be used as a treatment option. CYSLTR1 expressions were also higher in ICU group than non-ICU group. Thus, CYSLTR1 mRNA expression could be a promising biomarker of COVID-19 severity.",2023,12,28
"International strategies, experiences, and payment models to incentivise day surgery.","The importance of day surgery as a less costly alternative compared to conventional inpatient hospital stays is growing internationally. The rate of day surgery activities has increased across Europe. However, this trend has been heterogeneous across countries, and might still be below its potential. Since payment systems affect how providers offer care, they represent a policy instrument to further increase the rate of day surgeries. In this paper, we review international strategies to promote day surgery with a particular focus on payment models for 13 OECD countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, England, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland). We conduct a cross-country comparison based on an email survey of health policy experts and a comprehensive literature review of peer-reviewed papers and grey literature. Our research shows that all countries aim to strengthen day surgery activity to increase health system efficiency. Several countries used financial and non-financial policy measures to overcome misaligned incentive structures and promote day surgery activity. Financial incentives for day surgery can serve as a policy instrument to promote change. We recommend embedding these incentives in a comprehensive approach of restructuring health systems. In addition, we encourage countries to monitor and evaluate the effect of changes to payment systems on day surgeries to allow for more informed decision-making.",2023,12,17
Current Concepts in the Business of Orthopaedics.,"Practice management within orthopaedic surgery demands a multifaceted skillset including clinical expertise, technical proficiency, and business acumen, yet the latter is rarely taught during orthopaedic training. As the healthcare system evolves in the United States, surgeons continue to face challenges such as decreasing reimbursements, increased regulatory burdens, and potential for practice acquisition. To remain competitive and provide exceptional care for patients, orthopaedic surgeons must cultivate a business-minded approach. This article highlights the growing significance of the business of orthopaedics and offers guidance on ambulatory surgical center ownership models, effective management of ancillary services, the effect of private equity in orthopaedic practice, real estate investment opportunities in medical office buildings, and the importance of brand recognition. By understanding these concepts, orthopaedic surgeons can exercise greater control over their practice's finances while providing quality care for their patients.",2023,12,27
Ferroptosis and its modulators: A raising target for cancer and Alzheimer's disease.,"The process of ferroptosis, a recently identified form of regulated cell death (RCD) is associated with the overloading of iron species and lipid-derived ROS accumulation. Ferroptosis is induced by various mechanisms such as inhibiting system Xc, glutathione depletion, targeting excess iron, and directly inhibiting GPX4 enzyme. Also, ferroptosis inhibition is achieved by blocking excessive lipid peroxidation by targeting different pathways. These mechanisms are often related to the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. Fundamentally distinct from other forms of cell death, such as necrosis and apoptosis, ferroptosis differs in terms of biochemistry, functions, and morphology. The mechanism by which ferroptosis acts as a regulatory factor in many diseases remains elusive. Studying the activation and inhibition of ferroptosis as a means to mitigate the progression of various diseases is a highly intriguing and actively researched topic. It has emerged as a focal point in etiological research and treatment strategies. This review systematically summarizes the different mechanisms involved in the inhibition and induction of ferroptosis. We have extensively explored different agents that can induce or inhibit ferroptosis. This review offers current perspectives on recent developments in ferroptosis research, highlighting the disease's etiology and presenting references to enhance its understanding. It also explores new targets for the treatment of cancer and Alzheimer's disease.",2023,12,20
Fluid and tissue biomarkers in Parkinson's disease: Immunodetection or seed amplification? Central or peripheral?,"Over the last two decades there have been meaningful developments on biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases, extensively (but not solely) focusing on their proteinopathic nature. Accordingly, in Alzheimer's disease determination of levels of total and phosphorylated tau (τ and p-τ, usually p-τ181) along with amyloid-beta1-42 (Aβ1-42) by immunodetection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and currently even in peripheral blood, have been widely accepted and introduced to routine diagnosis. In the case of Parkinson's disease, α-synuclein as a potential biomarker (both for diagnosis and progression tracking) has proved more elusive under the immunodetection approach. In recent years, the emergence of the so-called seed amplification assays is proving to be a game-changer, with mounting evidence under different technical approaches and using a variety of biofluids or tissues, yielding promising diagnostic accuracies. Currently the least invasive but at once more reliable source of biosamples and techniques are being sought. Here we overview these advances.",2023,12,27
Benign prostatic hyperplasia - A novel autoimmune disease with a potential therapy consequence?,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is considered as an age-related disease of men with an unknown etiopathophysiology. Chronic inflammation has been proposed as one of the major pathophysiological mechanisms. There is growing evidence for the involvement of autoimmune responses in an inflammatory setting in the prostate. Patients with autoimmune diseases show a significantly elevated prevalence of BPH. Conventional therapy options for BPH are limited, rendering surgery the ultimate alternative. However, immunosuppression via tumor necrosis factor alpha blocker appears to reduce symptoms in patients with BPH and concurrent autoimmune disease due to the reduction of epithelial hyperplasia and macrophage-induced inflammation. New diagnostic options using HEp-2 cells with overexpression of LEDGF/p75 or mitochondrial DNA as autoimmune targets could be used to identify BPH patients with autoimmune responses. Given the presumed involvement of autoimmune responses in BPH and the efficacy of immunosuppression in reducing BPH symptoms, BPH or subvariants of BPH may be candidates for a new autoimmune disease in males.",2023,12,31
Cancer genetic mutation prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa: A review of existing data.,"Cancer represents a leading cause of death worldwide. Germline mutations in several genes increase the risk of developing several cancers, including cancers of the breast, ovary, pancreas, colorectum, and melanoma. An understanding of the population prevalence of pathogenic germline variants can be helpful in the design of public health interventions, such as genetic testing, which has downstream implications for cancer screening, prevention, and treatment. While population-based studies of pathogenic germline variants exist, most such studies have been conducted in White populations. Limited data exist regarding the prevalence of germline mutations within sub-Saharan African populations.",2023,12,27
Breath-based biosensors and system development for noninvasive detection of diabetes: A review.,"In recent years, noninvasive techniques are becoming conspicuous for diabetes detection. Sweat, tear, saliva, urine and breath-based methods showing prominent results in breath acetone detection which is considered as a biomarker of diabetes. A concrete relationship between breath acetone and BG helps in the development of devices for diabetes detection.",2023,12,20
Insights into the preventive actions of natural compounds against Klebsiella pneumoniae infections and drug resistance.,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is a type of Gram-negative bacteria that causes a variety of infections, including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound infections, and meningitis. The treatment of K. pneumoniae infection depends on the type of infection and the severity of the symptoms. Antibiotics are generally used to treat K. pneumoniae infections. However, some strains of K. pneumoniae have become resistant to antibiotics. This comprehensive review examines the potential of natural compounds as effective strategies against K. pneumonia infections. The alarming rise in antibiotic resistance underscores the urgent need for alternative therapies. This article represents current research on the effects of diverse natural compounds, highlighting their anti-microbial and antibiofilm properties against K. pneumonia. Notably, compounds such as andrographolide, artemisinin, baicalin, berberine, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, eugenol, mangiferin, piperine, quercetin, resveratrol, and thymol have been extensively investigated. These compounds exhibit multifaceted mechanisms, including disruption of bacterial biofilms, interference with virulence factors, and augmentation of antibiotic effectiveness. Mechanistic insights into their actions include membrane perturbation, oxidative stress induction, and altered gene expression. While promising, challenges such as limited bioavailability and varied efficacy across bacterial strains are addressed. This review further discusses the potential of natural compounds as better alternatives in combating K. pneumonia infection and emphasizes the need for continued research to harness their full therapeutic potential. As antibiotic resistance persists, these natural compounds offer a promising avenue in the fight against K. pneumonia and other multidrug-resistant pathogens.",2023,12,31
Advanced strategies in high-throughput droplet screening for enzyme engineering.,"Enzymes, as biocatalysts, play a cumulatively important role in environmental purification and industrial production of chemicals and pharmaceuticals. However, natural enzymes are limited by their physiological properties in practice, which need to be modified driven by requirements. Screening and isolating certain enzyme variants or ideal industrial strains with high yielding of target product enzymes is one of the main directions of enzyme engineering research. Droplet-based high-throughput screening (DHTS) technology employs massive monodisperse emulsion droplets as microreactors to achieve single strain encapsulation, as well as continuous monitoring for the inside mutant library. It can effectively sort out strains or enzymes with desired characteristics, offering a throughput of 10<sup>8</sup> events per hour. Much of the early literature focused on screening various engineered strains or designing signalling sorting strategies based on DHTS technology. However, the field of enzyme engineering lacks a comprehensive overview of advanced methods for microfluidic droplets and their cutting-edge developments in generation and manipulation. This review emphasizes the advanced strategies and frontiers of microfluidic droplet generation and manipulation facilitating enzyme engineering development. We also introduce design for various screening signals that cooperate with DHTS and devote to enzyme engineering.",2023,12,26
Intravitreal enzyme replacement for inherited retinal diseases.,This paper provides an update on intravitreal (IVT) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in metabolic retinal diseases; particularly neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) also known as Batten disease.,2023,12,27
Updates in the Surgical Management of Benign and High-Risk Breast Lesions.,"Benign breast disease (BBD) is a heterogenous group of lesions often classified as nonproliferative or proliferative, with the latter group further categorized based on the presence of atypia. Although nonproliferative lesions are more common, the risk of breast cancer is elevated in women with proliferative lesions. Historically, the majority of proliferative lesions were excised due to concern for future and/or concomitant breast cancer at the site of the index lesion. However, contemporary data suggest that the risk of cancer associated with various proliferative lesions may be lower than previously thought, and management of BBD has become more nuanced. In this review, we will focus on recent updates in the management of a select group of benign and high-risk lesions.",2023,12,21
MRI features and disability in multiple sclerosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate the correlation between disability in patients with Multiple sclerosis (MS) measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) features to provide reliable results on which characteristics in the MRI can predict disability and prognosis of the disease.",2023,12,07
Clinical Management of Gastrointestinal and Liver Toxicities of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have transformed the treatment paradigm for various types of cancer. Nonetheless, with the utilization of these groundbreaking treatments, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are increasingly encountered. Colonic and hepatic involvement are among the most frequently encountered irAEs. Drug-induced side effects, infectious causes, and tumor-related symptoms are the key differentials for irAE complications. Potential risk factors for the development of irAEs include combination use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, past development of irAEs with other immunotherapy treatments, certain concomitant drugs, and a pre-existing personal or family history of autoimmune illness such as inflammatory bowel disease. The importance of early recognition, timely and proper management cannot be understated, as there are profound clinical implications on the overall cancer treatment plan and prognosis once these adverse events occur. Herein, we cover the clinical management of the well-established gastrointestinal irAEs of enterocolitis and hepatitis, and also provide an overview of several other emerging entities.",2023,12,16
Uteroovarian pathway for embryo-empowered maintenance of the corpus luteum in farm animals.,"The first luteal response to pregnancy in farm animals at 12-18 days after ovulation involves maintenance of the corpus luteum (CL) if pregnancy has occurred. In most common farm species, regression of the CL results from production of a luteolysin (PGF2α) by the nongravid uterus, and maintenance of the CL involves the production of an antiluteolysin (PGE2) by the gravid uterus and conceptus. The proximal component of a unilateral pathway from a uterine horn to the adjacent CL for transport of PGF2α and PGE2 is the uterine venous and lymphatic vessels and the distal component is the ovarian artery. The mechanisms for venolymphatic arterial transport of PGF2α and PGE2 from a uterine horn to the adjacent CL ovary and transfer of each prostaglandin through the walls of the uteroovarian vein and ovarian artery occur by similar mechanisms probably as a consequence of similarities in molecular structure between the two prostaglandins. Reported conclusions or interpretations during the first luteal response to pregnancy in sows and ewes are that PGE2 increases in concentration in the uteroovarian vein and ovarian artery and counteracts the negative effect of PGF2α on the CL. In cows, treatment with PGE2 increases circulating progesterone concentrations and prevents spontaneous luteolysis and luteolysis induced by estradiol, an intrauterine device, or PGF2α. The prevailing acceptance that interferon tau is the primary factor for maintaining the CL during early pregnancy in ruminants will likely become tempered by the increasing reports on PGE2.",2023,12,23
Cross-neutralization activities of antibodies against 18 lyssavirus glycoproteins.,"Some lyssaviruses, including the rabies virus (RABV), induce lethal neurological symptoms in humans. However, commercial vaccines have only been evaluated for their efficacy against RABV and not against other lyssaviruses. To assess cross-reactivity among lyssaviruses, including RABV, sera from rabbits inoculated with human and animal RABV vaccines and polyclonal antibodies from rabbits immunized with expression plasmids of the glycoproteins of all 18 lyssaviruses were prepared, and cross-reactivity was evaluated via virus-neutralization tests using RABV, European bat lyssavirus-1 (EBLV-1), Duvenhage virus (DUVV), Mokola virus (MOKV), and Lagos bat virus (LBV). The sera against RABV vaccines showed cross-reactivity with EBLV-1 and DUVV, which both belong to phylogroup I. However, the reactivity with MOKV and LBV in phylogroup II was notably limited or below the detection level. Next, we compared the cross-reactivity of the polyclonal antibodies against all the lyssavirus glycoproteins. Polyclonal antibodies had high virus-neutralization titers against the same phylogroup, but not against different phylogroups. Our findings indicate that a new vaccine should be developed for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis against lyssavirus infections.",2023,12,28
The Role of Amino Acid Supplementation in Orthopaedic Surgery.,"The nutritional status of patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery has started to garner increasing attention in published literature. Notable previous evidence has demonstrated the negative effect of malnutrition on outcomes after orthopaedic procedures. Although there has been increased recognition of malnutrition as a risk factor for suboptimal outcomes, the use of nutritional supplementation to mitigate those risks is not well understood. The purpose of this review of most current literature on the topic is to introduce and elucidate the role of amino acid supplementation as a countermeasure to muscle loss and improvement of nutritional status in orthopaedic patients to improve results and outcomes after orthopaedic surgery.",2023,12,28
Incidental Bleeding Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor Identified on 99mTc-RBC Scintigraphy.,"Various pathologies could lead to occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Here we report the case of a 73-year-old woman who presented with hematochezia and syncope, and was found to have a large bleeding GI stromal tumor incidentally from 99mTc-RBC scintigraphy. This study was done after negative workup with CT angiography, colonoscopy, and capsule endoscopy for the source of GI bleeding. Final pathology confirmed the mass being a low-grade GI stromal tumor after exploratory laparotomy.",2023,12,23
Towards a better understanding of atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technology.,"Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technology is an emerging sustainable development strategy to deal with global water scarcity. To better understand the current state of AWH technology development, we conducted a bibliometric analysis highlighting three water harvesting technologies (fog harvesting, condensation, and sorption). By comprehensively reviewing the research progress and performing a comparative assessment of these technologies, we summarized past achievements and critically analyzed the different technologies. Traditional fog collectors are more mature, but their efficiency still needs to be improved. External field-driven fog harvesting and active condensation need to be driven by external forces, and passive condensation has high requirements for environmental humidity. Emerging bio-inspired fog harvesting and sorption technology provide new possibilities for atmospheric water collection, but they have high requirements for materials, and their commercial application is still to be further promoted. Based on the key characteristics of each technology, we presented the development prospects for the joint use of integrated/hybrid systems. Next, the water-energy relationship is used as a link to clarify the future development strategy of AWH technology in energy driving and conversion. Finally, we outlined the core ideas of AWH for both basic research and practical applications and described its limitless possibilities for drinking water supply and agricultural irrigation. This review provides an essential reference for the development and practical application of AWH technologies, which contribute to the sustainable utilization of water resources globally.",2023,12,22
cGMP modulates hemin-mediated platelet death.,"Hemolysis is a known risk factor for thrombosis resulting in critical limb ischemia and microcirculatory disturbance and organ failure. Intravasal hemolysis may lead to life-threatening complications due to uncontrolled thrombo-inflammation. Until now, conventional antithrombotic therapies failed to control development and progression of these thrombotic events. Thus, the pathophysiology of these thrombotic events needs to be investigated to unravel underlying pathways and thereby identify targets for novel treatment strategies.",2023,12,21
"Discovery of 4-amino-1,6-dihydro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyridazin-7-one derivatives as potential receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) inhibitors.","Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is an important regulatory factor in the necroptosis signaling pathway, and is considered an attractive therapeutic target for treating multiple inflammatory diseases. Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships of 4-amino-1,6-dihydro-7H-pyrrolo [2,3-d]pyridazin-7-one derivatives as RIPK1 inhibitors. Among them, 13c showed favorable RIPK1 kinase inhibition activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 59.8 nM, and high RIPK1 binding affinity compared with other regulatory kinases of necroptosis (RIPK1 K<sub>d</sub> = 3.5 nM, RIPK3 K<sub>d</sub> = 1700 nM, and MLKL K<sub>d</sub> > 30,000 nM). 13c efficiently blocked TNFα-induced necroptosis in both human and murine cells (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.06-4.58 nM), and inhibited TSZ-induced phosphorylation of the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway. In liver microsomal assay studies, the clearance rate and half-life of 13c were 18.40 mL/min/g and 75.33 min, respectively. 13c displayed acceptable pharmacokinetic characteristics, with oral bioavailability of 59.55%. In TNFα-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome, pretreatment with 13c could effectively protect mice from loss of body temperature and death. Overall, these compounds are promising candidates for future optimization studies.",2023,12,27
Single port (SP) robotic pyeloplasty in a pediatric patient.,"We began using the da Vinci single port (SP) robot for pediatric urologic surgeries at our institution due to limited access to the multiport robot. Availability of this technology has allowed us to schedule cases in a timelier fashion and increase access to minimally invasive urologic surgery for children in our area. Here, we report our technique for transperitoneal SP robotic pyeloplasty in the case of a 7 year-old boy with left ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Our technique was refined over a series of 10 patients under the age of 18. Highlights of the SP RALP technique include one 3 cm, concealed incision over the pubic tubercle, gentle frog leg positioning and burping of the boom to create optimal angle for robotic docking, and use of a ""floating dock"" to obtain 10 cm distance from target anatomy which is essential in smaller pediatric patients. SP pyeloplasty is safe and feasible in children and offers a concealed single incision alternative to the multiport approach.",2023,12,14
Imaging and Biomarker Surveillance for Head and Neck Squamous cell carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Appropriate Use Criteria Document.,"Surveillance for survivors of head and neck cancer (HNC) is focused on early detection of recurrent or second primary malignancies. After initial restaging confirms disease-free status, there is controversy regarding the use of surveillance imaging for asymptomatic patients with HNC. Our objective was to comprehensively review literature pertaining to imaging and biomarker surveillance of asymptomatic patients treated for HNSCC, and to convene a multidisciplinary expert panel to provide appropriate use criteria for surveillance in representative clinical scenarios.",2023,12,31
Updated efficacy and safety of entrectinib in NTRK fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer.,"NTRK fusions result in constitutively active oncogenic TRK proteins responsible for ∼ 0.2 % of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. Approximately 40 % of patients with advanced NSCLC develop CNS metastases; therefore, treatments with intracranial (IC) efficacy are needed. In an integrated analysis of three phase I/II studies (ALKA-372-001: EudraCT 2012-000148-88; STARTRK-1: NCT02097810; STARTRK-2: NCT02568267), entrectinib, a potent, CNS-active, TRK inhibitor, demonstrated efficacy in patients with NTRK fusion-positive (fp) NSCLC (objective response rate [ORR]: 64.5 %; 2 August 2021 data cut-off). We present updated data for this cohort.",2023,12,15

"Ochrolines A-C, three new indole diketopiperazines from cultures of endophytic fungi Bionectria ochroleuca SLJB-2.","Three new indole diketopiperazines, ochrolines A-C (1-3), along with three known compounds (4-6), were isolated and identified from the EtOAc extract of the solid fermentation of Bionectria ochroleuca SLJB-2. Notably, compound 1 featured a natural rarely-occurring caged skeleton with a 6/5/6/7 heterotetracyclic bridged ring system. The structures including absolute configurations of 1-3 were fully accomplished by extensive spectroscopic analyses, DFT GIAO <sup>13</sup>C NMR and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. The plausible biogenetic pathways of these new indole diketopiperazines were also proposed. Moreover, the cytotoxic activity screening revealed that compound 2 exhibited moderate inhibitory effect against A549 with inhibition rate of 57.44% at the concentration of 50 μM and compound 1 exhibited mild inhibitory activities against A549, Hela and MCF-7.",2023,12,31
[Treatment strategies for deep caries].,"Deep caries occurs when caries progresses to the deep dentin layer, and further progression has the risk of pulp exposure, which may affect pulp vitality and tooth longevity. Currently, there are no objective standards for the diagnosis of deep caries. In addition, traditional therapy for deep caries emphasizes complete debridement of the decayed tissue, resulting in an incremental high risk of pulp exposure. There are different views on how to deal with the remaining dentin after caries removal, and root canal treatment is often adopted directly after pulp exposure. In recent years, due to advances in dental pulp biology, bioactive pulp-capping materials, and clinical evidence-based medicine, the principle of deep caries treatment has shifted to pulp protection.

Insights into the role of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) are prevalent in aquatic environments. Discharge from wastewater treatment plants is an important point source of ARG release into the environment. It has been reported that biological treatment processes may enhance rather than remove ARG because of their presence in sludge. Attenuation of ARG in biotechnological processes has been studied in depth, showing that many microorganisms can secrete complex extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). These EPS can serve as multifunctional elements of microbial communities, involving aspects, such as protection, structure, recognition, adhesion, and physiology. These aspects can influence the interaction between microbial cells and extracellular ARG, as well as the uptake of extracellular ARG by microbial cells, thus changing the transformative capability of extracellular ARG. However, it remains unclear whether EPS can affect horizontal ARG transfer, which is one of the main processes of ARG dissemination. In light of this knowledge gap, this review provides insight into the role of EPS in the transmission of ARGs; furthermore, the mechanism of ARG spread is analyzed, and the molecular compositions and functional properties of EPS are summarized; also, how EPS influence ARG mitigation is addressed, and factors impacting how EPS facilitate ARG during wastewater treatment are summarized. This review provides comprehensive insights into the role of EPS in controlling the transport and fate of ARG during biodegradation processes at the mechanistic level.",2023,12,31
Susceptibility-weighted image features in AQP4-negative-NMOSD versus MS.,"To characterize the susceptibility-weighted image (SWI) features including paramagnetic rim and nodular lesions with signal intensity changes and central vein sign (CVS) associated with aquaporin 4 (AQP4)-immunoglobulin G (IgG)-negative neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and explore whether they can be used as potential imaging biomarkers for differentiating multiple sclerosis (MS) from this disorder.",2023,12,28
Identifying distant relatives using benchtop-scale sequencing.,"The genetic component of forensic genetic genealogy (FGG) is an estimate of kinship, often conducted at genome scales between a great number of individuals. The promise of FGG is substantial: in concert with genealogical records and other nongenetic information, it can indirectly identify a person of interest. A downside of FGG is cost, as it is currently expensive and requires chemistries uncommon to forensic genetic laboratories (microarrays and high throughput sequencing). The more common benchtop sequencers can be coupled with a targeted PCR assay to conduct FGG, though such approaches have limited resolution for kinship. This study evaluates low-pass sequencing, an alternative strategy that is accessible to benchtop sequencers and can produce resolutions comparable to high-pass sequencing. Samples from a three-generation pedigree were augmented to include up to 7th degree relatives (using whole genome pedigree simulations) and the ability to recover the true kinship coefficient was assessed using algorithms qualitatively similar to those found in GEDmatch. We show that up to 7th degree relatives can be reliably inferred from 1 × whole genome sequencing obtainable from desktop sequencers.",2023,12,27

Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Erythropoietin Therapy for Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Erythropoietin (EPO) is a proposed drug for the treatment of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Multiple studies have linked its use, either as a monotherapy or in conjunction with therapeutic hypothermia (TH), with improved neonatal outcomes including death and neurodisability. However, there is also evidence in the literature that raises concerns about its efficacy and safety for the treatment of neonatal encephalopathy (NE).",2023,12,14
Vaccine effects on COVID-19 infection with bivalent boosting by age group.,"This paper examines time-series vaccine effectiveness on COVID-19 infection with/without a bivalent booster dose by 6 age groups such as 18-29, 30-49, 50-64, 65-79, 80+, and all_ages respectively. CDC's COVID data on rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths by updated (bivalent) booster status was used in this study. This result concludes that there is no difference between vaccines with or without a bivalent booster dose for preventing COVID-19 infection in 6 age groups 18-29, 30-49, 50-64, 65-79, 80+, and all_ages. Vaccination is effective in two age groups of 65-79 and 80+ for preventing COVID-19 infection. However, vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infection has not been confirmed in the 18-29 and 30-49 age groups.",2023,12,27
"If we build it, will they come? A scoping review of objective engagement metrics in asynchronous psychosocial telehealth interventions for breast cancer survivors.","Burgeoning technologies and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a boom of telehealth for immunocompromised patients, such as those with cancer. Telehealth modalities overcome barriers and promote accessibility to care. Currently, efficacious psychosocial interventions exist to address negative aftereffects of a cancer diagnosis and treatment. Many of these interventions often incorporate asynchronous telehealth (e.g., web-based, smartphone mobile app) features. However, asynchronous platforms are limited by suboptimal engagement. Subjective indicators of perceived engagement in the forms of acceptability, feasibility, and adherence are often captured, yet prior research has found discrepancies between perceived and actual engagement. The FITT (frequency, intensity, time/duration, type of engagement) model, originally developed for use to quantify engagement within exercise trials, provides a framework to assess objective engagement of psychosocial interventions for breast cancer. Using 14 keywords and searching six databases through 11/2023, 56 studies that used asynchronous telehealth interventions in breast cancer were identified. All FITT domains were reported at least once across studies with intensity metrics most commonly reported. Nine metrics were described across FITT domains. Human-centered design principles to guide telehealth development and privacy considerations are discussed. Findings offer suggestions for how to represent and optimize objective engagement in asynchronous telehealth cancer care.",2023,12,29

Inhibitory effects of estetrol on the invasion and migration of immortalized human endometrial stromal cells.,"Endometriosis, a common gynecological disorder characterized by the growth of endometrial gland and stroma outside the uterus, causes several symptoms such as dysmenorrhea, hypermenorrhea, and chronic abdominal pain. 17β estradiol (E2) stimulates the growth of endometriotic lesions. Although estetrol (E4), produced by human fetal liver, is also a natural estrogen, it may have the opposite effects on endometriotic cells. We investigated different effects of E4 and E2 on the invasion and migration of immortalized human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) and evaluated whether E4 affects the expression of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family member 1 (WASF-1). We measured the invasion of HESCs by a Matrigel chamber assay. Cell migration was measured by wound healing assay and cell tracking analysis. The expression of WASF-1 was confirmed by independent real-time PCR analysis. Transfection of cells with siRNAs was carried out to knock down the expression of WASF-1 in HESCs. E4 significantly inhibited E2-induced invasion and migration of HESCs. WASF-1 was found to be a potential mediator based on metastasis PCR array. WASF-1 was upregulated by E2 and downregulated by E4. Knockdown of WASF-1 inhibited migration. Our results suggest that E4 may inhibit E2-induced growth of endometriotic lesions. Downregulation of WASF-1 is involved in the inhibitory effects of E4 on migration. The use of E4 combined with progestins as combined oral contraceptives may cause endometriotic lesions to regress in women with endometriosis.",2023,12,28
"Structure-activity relationship study of 1,6-naphthyridinone derivatives as selective type II AXL inhibitors with potent antitumor efficacy.","The role of AXL in various oncogenic processes has made it an attractive target for cancer therapy. Currently, kinase selectivity profiles, especially circumventing MET inhibition, remain a scientific issue of great interest in the discovery of selective type II AXL inhibitors. Starting from a dual MET/AXL-targeted lead structure from our previous work, we optimized a 1,6-naphthyridinone series using molecular modeling-assisted compound design to improve AXL potency and selectivity over MET, resulting in the potent and selective type II AXL-targeted compound 25c. This showed excellent AXL inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.1 nM) and 343-fold selectivity over the highly homologous kinase MET in biochemical assays. Moreover, compound 25c significantly inhibited AXL-driven cell proliferation, dose-dependently suppressed 4T1 cell migration and invasion, and induced apoptosis. Compound 25c also showed noticeable antitumor efficacy in a BaF3/TEL-AXL xenograft model at well-tolerated doses. Overall, this study presented a potent and selective type II AXL-targeted lead compound for further drug discovery.",2023,12,30
Nitrogen doped 1 T/2H mixed phase MoS<sub>2</sub>/CuS heterostructure nanosheets for enhanced peroxidase activity.,"Heteroatom doping and phase engineering are effective ways to promote the catalytic activity of nanoenzymes. Nitrogen-doped 1 T/2H mixed phase MoS<sub>2</sub>/CuS heterostructure nanosheets N-1 T/2H-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CuS are prepared by a simple hydrothermal approach using polyoxometalate (POM)-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (NENU-5) as a precursor and urea as nitrogen doping reagent. The XPS spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectrum of N-1 T/2H-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CuS prove the successful N-doping. NENU-5 was used as the template to prepare 1 T/2H-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CuS with high content of 1 T phase by optimizing the reaction time. The use of urea as nitrogen dopant added to 1 T/2H-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CuS, resulted in N-1 T/2H-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CuS with an increase in the content of the 1 T phase from 80 % to 84 % and higher number of defects. N-1 T/2H-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CuS shows higher peroxidase activity than 1 T/2H-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CuS and a catalytic efficiency (K<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> twice as high as that of 1 T/2H-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CuS. The enhanced catalytic activity has probably been attributed to several reasons: (i) the insertion of urea during the hydrothermal process in the S-Mo-S layer of MoS<sub>2</sub>, causing an increase in the interlayer spacing and in 1 T phase content, (ii) the replacement of S atoms in MoS<sub>2</sub> by N atoms from the urea decomposition, resulting in more defects and more active sites. As far as we know, N-1 T/2H-MoS<sub>2</sub>/CuS nanosheets have the lowest detection limit (0.16 µm) for the colorimetric detection of hydroquinone among molybdenum disulfide-based catalysts. This study affords a new approach for the fabrication of high-performance nanoenzyme catalysts.",2023,12,30
Molecular epidemiology of human metapneumovirus before and after COVID-19 in East Japan in 2017-2022.,"Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is genetically classified into two major subgroups, A and B, based on attachment glycoprotein (G) gene sequences, and the A2 subgroup is further separated into three subdivisions A2a, A2b (A2b1), and A2c (A2b2). The appearance of subgroup A2c viruses carrying a 180- or 111-nucleotide duplication in the G gene (A2c<sub>180nt-dup</sub> or A2c<sub>111nt-dup</sub>) have been reported in Japan and Spain. The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disrupted the epidemiological kinetics of other respiratory viruses, including hMPV. In this study, we analysed the sequences of hMPV isolates obtained from 2017 to 2022 in Tokyo and Fukushima, i.e., before and after COVID-19. Subgroup A hMPVs were detected in 2017 to 2019, and most cases were A2c<sub>111nt-dup</sub>, suggesting there was continuous momentum of this clade, identical to the global situation. Subgroup B, but not subgroup A, viruses were detected in 2022, after the COVID-19 peak. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these resumed subgroup B viruses were closely related to the viruses detected in 2013 to 2016 in Yokohama and in 2019 in Fukushima, suggesting a reappearance of local endemic viruses in East Japan.",2023,12,28

Time-restricted eating: Watching the clock to treat obesity.,"Time-restricted eating (TRE) has become a popular strategy to treat obesity. TRE involves confining the eating window to 4-10 h per day and fasting for the remaining hours (14-20 h fast). During the eating window, individuals are not required to monitor food intake. The sudden rise in popularity of TRE is most likely due to its simplicity and the fact that it does not require individuals to count calories to lose weight. This feature of TRE may appeal to certain individuals with obesity, and this could help produce lasting metabolic health improvements. The purpose of this review is to summarize current evidence from randomized clinical trials of TRE (without calorie counting) on body weight and metabolic risk factors. The efficacy of TRE in various populations groups, including those with obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is also examined.",2023,12,19
CDRIME-MTIS: An enhanced rime optimization-driven multi-threshold segmentation for COVID-19 X-ray images.,"To improve the detection of COVID-19, this paper researches and proposes an effective swarm intelligence algorithm-driven multi-threshold image segmentation (MTIS) method. First, this paper proposes a novel RIME structure integrating the Co-adaptive hunting and dispersed foraging strategies, called CDRIME. Specifically, the Co-adaptive hunting strategy works in coordination with the basic search rules of RIME at the individual level, which not only facilitates the algorithm to explore the global optimal solution but also enriches the population diversity to a certain extent. The dispersed foraging strategy further enriches the population diversity to help the algorithm break the limitation of local search and thus obtain better convergence. Then, on this basis, a new multi-threshold image segmentation method is proposed by combining the 2D non-local histogram with 2D Kapur entropy, called CDRIME-MTIS. Finally, the results of experiments based on IEEE CEC2017, IEEE CEC2019, and IEEE CEC2022 demonstrate that CDRIME has superior performance than some other basic, advanced, and state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of global search, convergence performance, and escape from local optimality. Meanwhile, the segmentation experiments on COVID-19 X-ray images demonstrate that CDRIME is more advantageous than RIME and other peers in terms of segmentation effect and adaptability to different threshold levels. In conclusion, the proposed CDRIME significantly enhances the global optimization performance and image segmentation of RIME and has great potential to improve COVID-19 diagnosis.",2023,12,15
Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of obesity with disability between age 50 and 90 in the SHARE study.,"Obesity is associated with disability but whether age and ageing modify this association remains unclear.

Effects of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and TGF-β signaling pathway.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) develops as a result of unhealthy lifestyle but improves with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). The transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling pathway reportedly contributes to liver fibrosis, mainly in animal experiments. The aim of the present study was to evaluate changes in serum proteins before and after LSG by proteomic analysis and to investigate their association with NAFLD. This study enrolled 36 severely obese patients who underwent LSG at our hospital from January 2020 to April 2022. As a pilot study, proteomic analysis was conducted on six patients using serum collected before and at 6 months after LSG, and significantly fluctuating proteins were extracted. Subsequently, verification by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using collected serum was performed on the remaining 30 patients. The mean weight of enrolled patients was 118.5 kg. Proteomic analysis identified 1,912 proteins, many of which were related to the TGF-β signaling pathway. Among these proteins, we focused on five TGF-β-related proteins: asporin, EMILIN-1, platelet factor-4, serglycin, and thrombospondin-1. Verification by ELISA revealed that asporin (p = 0.006) and thrombospondin-1 (p = 0.043) levels significantly fluctuated before and after LSG. Univariate analysis with a linear regression model showed that aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.045), asporin (p = 0.011), and thrombospondin-1 (p = 0.022) levels were significantly associated with postoperative liver fibrosis. On multivariate analysis, asporin was an independent prognostic factor for postoperative liver fibrosis (95% confidence interval: 0.114-1.291, p = 0.002). TGF-β-related proteins dramatically fluctuated before and after LSG and were correlated with NAFLD pathogenesis. Asporin may be a useful prognostic marker of liver fibrosis in NAFLD after LSG.",2023,12,28
Subtotal vs total cholecystectomy for difficult gallbladders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"With severely inflamed gallbladders, laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be difficult and may require procedures like subtotal cholecystectomy (SC).

Pancreatic injury is associated with poor prognosis in severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome.,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease. Previous studies have mainly focused on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with SFTS, while pancreatic injury has received little attention. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of pancreatic injury on the prognosis of patients with SFTS. A total of 156 SFTS patients were included in the analysis from April 2016 to April 2022. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that pancreatic injury (OR=3.754, 95% CI 1.361-79.036, P=0.024) and neurological symptoms (OR=18.648, 95% CI 4.921-70.668, P<0.001) were independent risk factors for patient death. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicated that serum pancreatic enzymes (PEs) were predictive of progression to death in SFTS patients. The area under the curve (AUC) for amylase (AMY) was 0.711, with an optimal cut-off value of 95.5 (U/L), sensitivity of 96.4%, and specificity of 35.9%. Lipase (LIP) had an AUC of 0.754, an optimal cut-off value of 354.75 (U/L), a sensitivity of 75%, and a specificity of 67.2%. Thus, pancreatic injury is associated with a poor prognosis of SFTS and can be used as an important reference for SFTS disease determination and prognostic assessment.",2023,12,28
Microplastic-induced inhibition of cell adhesion and toxicity evaluation using human dermal fibroblast-derived spheroids.,"Nanoplastics and microplastics (MPs) can significantly affect marine ecosystems and pose potential risks to human health. Although adverse effects stemming from direct exposure to MPs have been demonstrated at the cellular level in animal models, the potential toxicity of these materials in the human body remains uncertain. In this study, we investigated the three-dimensional (3D) behavior of dermal-derived cells exposed to MPs using artificially manufactured spherical primary polystyrene (PS) particles. To explore these effects, we used cellular spheroids as a 3D cell culture model, examined the size-dependent penetration of PS-MPs, and observed morphological alterations in the spheroids. Furthermore, we assessed changes in physiological activities, including reactive oxygen species, adenosine triphosphate, and lactate dehydrogenase, to elucidate the potential intra- and extracellular toxic reactions to PS-MPs. Additionally, our examination of cell-cell junctions and the extracellular matrix (ECM), along with analysis of the regulators involved in their decreased integrity, revealed negatively influenced changes in expression. This exposure study using spheroid models provides new insights into the potential toxicity of short-term exposure to MPs under conditions that closely resemble in vivo systems.",2023,12,28
Self-controllable proteinic antibacterial coating with bacteria-triggered antibiotic release for prevention of periprosthetic infection.,"Periprosthetic infection is a devastating postimplantation complication in which a biofilm layer harboring invasive microorganisms forms around orthopedic implants, leading to severe implant failure and patient morbidity. Despite the development of several infection-triggered antibiotic release approaches, most current antibacterial coatings are susceptible to undesired antibiotic leakage or mechanical disintegration during prosthesis installation. Herein, we propose a self-controllable proteinic antibacterial coating capable of both long-lasting adherence onto titanium implant substrates over the implant fixation period and instantaneous bacterial eradication. Importantly, the pH-dependent reversible metal coordination of mussel adhesive protein (MAP) enabled bacterial concentration-dependent antibiotic delivery in response to infection-induced acidification. In addition, the MAP coating exhibited superior self-healable adhesive properties and scratch resistance, which enabled to avert issues associated with mechanical damages, including peeling and cracking, often occurring in conventional implant coating systems. The gentamicin-loaded MAP coating exhibited complete inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo against Staphylococcus aureus penetrations during implantation surgery (immediate infection) and even 4 weeks after implantation (delayed infection). Thus, our antibiotic-loaded MAP hydrogel coating can open new avenues for self-defensive antibiotic prophylaxis to achieve instant and sustainable bacteriocidal activity in orthopedic prostheses. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Loss of cardiac mitochondrial complex I persulfidation impairs NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in aging.,"Protein persulfidation is a significant post-translational modification that involves addition of a sulfur atom to the cysteine thiol group and is facilitated by sulfide species. Persulfidation targets reactive cysteine residues within proteins, influencing their structure and/or function across various biological systems. This modification is evolutionarily conserved and plays a crucial role in preventing irreversible cysteine overoxidation, a process that becomes prominent with aging. While, persulfidation decreases with age, its levels in the aged heart and the functional implications of such a reduction in cardiac metabolism remain unknown. Here we interrogated the cardiac persulfydome in wild-type adult mice and age-matched mice lacking the two sulfide generating enzymes, namely cystathionine gamma lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST). Our findings revealed that cardiac persulfidated proteins in wild type hearts are less abundant compared to those in other organs, with a primary involvement in mitochondrial metabolic processes. We further focused on one specific target, NDUFB7, which undergoes persulfidation by both CSE and 3MST derived sulfide species. In particular, persulfidation of cysteines C80 and C90 in NDUFB7 protects the protein from overoxidation and maintains the complex I activity in cardiomyocytes. As the heart ages, the levels of CSE and 3MST in cardiomyocytes decline, leading to reduced NDUFB7 persulfidation and increased cardiac NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. Collectively, our data provide compelling evidence for a direct link between cardiac persulfidation and mitochondrial complex I activity, which is compromised in aging.",2023,12,25

Therefore, we aimed to clarify the role of surgical drain bacterial contamination in predicting patients' postoperative course.",2023,12,30
Beyond probiotics: Exploring the potential of postbiotics and parabiotics in veterinary medicine.,"Postbiotics and parabiotics (PP) are emerging fields of study in animal nutrition, preventive veterinary medicine, and animal production. Postbiotics are bioactive compounds produced by beneficial microorganisms during the fermentation of a substrate, while parabiotics are inactivated beneficial microbial cells, either intact or broken. Unlike probiotics, which are live microorganisms, PP are produced from a fermentation process without live cells and show significant advantages in promoting animal health owing to their distinctive stability, safety, and functional diversity. PP have numerous beneficial effects on animal health, such as enhancing growth performance, improving the immune system and microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract, aiding ulcer healing, and preventing pathogenic microorganisms from colonizing in the skin. Moreover, PP have been identified as a potential alternative to traditional antibiotics in veterinary medicine due to their ability to improve animal health without the risk of antimicrobial resistance. This review comprehensively explores the current research and applications of PP in veterinary medicine. We aimed to thoroughly examine the mechanisms of action, benefits, and potential applications of PP in various species, emphasizing their use specifically in livestock and poultry. Additionally, we discuss the various routes of administration to animals, including feed, drinking water, and topical use. This review also presents in-depth information on the methodology behind the preparation of PP, outlining the criteria employed to select appropriate microorganisms, and highlighting the challenges commonly associated with PP utilization in veterinary medicine.",2023,12,31
"A fluorescent splice-switching mouse model enables high-throughput, sensitive quantification of antisense oligonucleotide delivery and activity.","While antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are used in the clinic, therapeutic development is hindered by the inability to assay ASO delivery and activity in vivo. Accordingly, we developed a dual-fluorescence, knockin mouse model that constitutively expresses mKate2 and an engineered EGFP that is alternatively spliced in the presence of ASO to induce expression. We first examined free ASO activity in the brain following intracerebroventricular injection revealing EGFP splice-switching is both ASO concentration and time dependent in major central nervous system cell types. We then assayed the impact of lipid nanoparticle delivery on ASO activity after intravenous administration. Robust EGFP fluorescence was observed in the liver and EGFP+ cells were successfully isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Together, these results show the utility of this animal model in quantifying both cell-type- and organ-specific ASO delivery, which can be used to advance ASO therapeutics for many disease indications.",2023,12,23
JADE1 is dispensable for the brain development in mice.,"In mammalian brain development, WNT signaling balances proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells, and is essential for the maintenance of regular brain development. JADE1 is a candidate transcription co-factor essential for DNA replication, cell division, and cell cycle regulation. In 293T cells, JADE1 is stabilized by von Hippel-Lindau protein pVHL, promotes the β-catenin ubiquitination and thus blunts canonical WNT signaling. Furthermore, JADE1 inhibits β-catenin-induced ectopic axis formation in Xenopus embryos. However, JADE1's role in mammalian brain development remains unknown. Here, we generated a new Jade1 knockout mouse line using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We found that JADE1 null resulted in decreased survival rate, reduced body weight and brain weight in mice. However, histological analysis revealed a normal brain development. Furthermore, Jade1 null neural progenitor cells proliferated normally in vivo and in vitro. RNA-seq analysis further showed that JADE1 loss did not affect the cerebral cortex gene expression. Our findings indicate that JADE1 is dispensable for developing the cerebral cortex in mice.",2023,12,27
Clinicopathological significances of cribriform pattern in lung adenocarcinoma.,"The present study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological and prognostic implications of the cribriform pattern in lung adenocarcinoma through a meta-analysis. The estimated rates of cribriform pattern in lung adenocarcinomas were investigated. The correlations between cribriform pattern and clinicopathological characteristics, including genetic alterations and prognosis were evaluated. The estimated rate of cribriform pattern was 0.150 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.101-0.218) in lung adenocarcinoma. The estimated rates of cribriform pattern in the 5% and 10% criteria were 0.230 (95% CI 0.125-0.386) and 0.130 (95% CI 0.062-0.252), respectively. The presence of cribriform pattern was significantly correlated with larger tumor size (> 30 mm), spread through air spaces, and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.007, respectively, in the meta-regression test). There were no significant differences between cribriform pattern, smoking history, and vascular and lymphatic invasion. In lung adenocarcinoma with cribriform pattern, the estimated rates of ALK rearrangement, KRAS, and EGFR mutations were 0.407 (95% CI 0.165-0.704), 0.330 (95% CI 0.117-0.646), and 0.249 (95% CI 0.125-0.437), respectively. ALK rearrangement was significantly more frequent in lung adenocarcinomas with cribriform pattern than in those without. The overall survival rate was significantly worse in lung adenocarcinomas with a cribriform pattern than in those without (hazard ratio 2.051, 95% CI 1.369-3.075). In conclusion, the presence of a cribriform pattern can be a useful predictor of the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients with lung adenocarcinoma.",2023,12,11
Rab26 alleviates sepsis-induced immunosuppression as a master regulator of macrophage ferroptosis and polarization shift.,"Macrophage dysfunction is a significant contributor to more than 70 % of sepsis-related deaths, specifically secondary bacterial infections, during the immunosuppression stage of sepsis. Nevertheless, the role of Rab26 in this context remains unclear. In this study, we observed a substantial decrease in Rab26 expression in macrophages during the immunosuppressive phase of sepsis, which was also found to be suppressed by high extracellular levels of HMGB1. During the progression of sepsis, Rab26 deficiency promotes a polarization shift from the M1 to the M2-like phenotype in macrophages, rendering them susceptible to ferroptosis. Subsequent experimentation has revealed that Rab26 deficiency facilitates the degradation of GPX4, thereby aggravating macrophage ferroptosis through the upregulation of levels of lipid ROS, MDA, and ferrous iron induced by RSL3, a ferroptosis inducer. Additionally, Rab26-deficient mice in the immunosuppressed phase of sepsis exhibit heightened susceptibility to secondary infections, leading to exacerbated lung tissue damage and increased mortality rate. Overall, these findings indicate that Rab26 plays a crucial role in sepsis-induced macrophage immunosuppression by regulating macrophage ferroptosis and polarization. Hence, it represents a potential novel target for sepsis therapy.",2023,12,31
Hyalinizing Clear Cell Carcinoma in the Sphenoid Sinus.,"A 39-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of headaches. Imaging revealed a mass with extensive destruction. T2-weighted imaging displayed mixture of low and sponge-like high intensities and also dark area, with FDG PET/CT showing uneven but intense accumulation. Biopsy confirmed EWSR1 rearrangement, and hyalinizing clear cell carcinoma (HCCC) was diagnosed. HCCC, recently renamed from clear cell carcinoma in the fifth edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Head and Neck Tumors, is a rare tumor. This case describes the features of T2-weighted imaging and FDG PET patterns in HCCC, possibly contributing to their consideration in the differential diagnosis.",2023,12,22
Efficacy and safety of argatroban in the management of acute ischemic stroke: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis.,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a leading cause of death and disability. AIS is caused by an embolus or thrombus that restricts blood flow to the brain tissue. Despite intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy, a substantial number of patients do not achieve effective reperfusion. Argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, can potentially improve neurological outcomes in AIS patients. However, there are conflicting results in the medical literature regarding the efficacy and safety of argatroban in this context.",2023,12,21
"Assessment and estimation of the effective dose due to external exposure from natural radioactivity of sands used in civil construction in the state of Rio de Janeiro,Brazil.","The presence of naturally occurring radioactivity in sand and other building materials results in indoor and outdoor exposure to the public. Sand is one of the main components in civil construction alongside cement, crushed stone and bricks. Thus, this research was carried out in twenty sand samples with the objective of investigating the hazard indices of natural radiation, due to the presence of <sup>238</sup>U, <sup>226</sup>Ra, <sup>232</sup>Th and <sup>40</sup>K in sand samples collected in some locations in the state of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), analyzing by gamma spectrometry and using an HPGe detector. The technique used for gamma analysis was gamma spectrometry, and the software used to analyze peaks and obtain counts was LabSOCS. In this context, the average activity concentration values of <sup>226</sup>Ra (66.7 ± 1.2) and <sup>40</sup>K (647 ± 31) Bq kg<sup>-1</sup> are higher than the world mean activity concentration of 50, 50 and 500 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup> for these three radionuclides. However, the value of <sup>232</sup>Th (40.6 ± 0.7) Bq kg<sup>-1</sup> and Raeq (175 ± 5) Bq kg<sup>-1</sup> are less than the world average of 50 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup> and 370 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The estimation of the average values for Annual Effective Dose (0.51 ± 0.01) and Dutch Radiation Performance Index (0.52 ± 0.01) was carried out, with values below the maximum recommended limit for the public. Only one sample had a higher value and the other samples are within the levels required for environmental control. However, the mean values found in this present study, when compared to those of other authors mentioned here, showed higher values. Therefore, most samples have safe values to be used by people in building their homes.",2023,12,31
Investigate the efficacy of size exclusion chromatography for the isolation of extracellular vesicles from C. elegans.,"Isolation of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) has been done extensively in the past using ultracentrifugation, a recent shift has been observed towards precipitation, and exosome isolation kits. These methods often co-elute contaminants of similar size and density which makes their detection and downstream applications quite challenging. As well as the EV yield is also compromised in some methodologies due to aggregate formation. In recent reports, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) is replacing density gradient-based ultracentrifugation as the gold standard of exosome isolation. It outperforms in yield, purity and does not account for any physical damage to the EVs. We have standardized the methodology for an efficient pure yield of homogenous exosomes of size even smaller than 75 nm in Caenorhabditis elegans homogenate. The paper entails the application and optimization of EV isolation by SEC based on previous studies by optimizing bed size and type of sepharose column employed. We propose that this method is economically feasible in comparison with currently available approaches. A comparative study was conducted to investigate the performance of CL-6B in relation to CL-2B and further, this was combined with ultracentrifugation for higher efficacy. The methodology could be introduced in a clinical setting due to its therapeutic potential and scope. The eluted EVs were studied by flow cytometry, nanotracking and characterized for size and morphology.",2023,12,30
A Bayesian fine-mapping model using a continuous global-local shrinkage prior with applications in prostate cancer analysis.,"The aim of fine mapping is to identify genetic variants causally contributing to complex traits or diseases. Existing fine-mapping methods employ Bayesian discrete mixture priors and depend on a pre-specified maximum number of causal variants, which may lead to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we propose a Bayesian fine-mapping method called h2-D2, utilizing a continuous global-local shrinkage prior. We also present an approach to define credible sets of causal variants in continuous prior settings. Simulation studies demonstrate that h2-D2 outperforms current state-of-the-art fine-mapping methods such as SuSiE and FINEMAP in accurately identifying causal variants and estimating their effect sizes. We further applied h2-D2 to prostate cancer analysis and discovered some previously unknown causal variants. In addition, we inferred 369 target genes associated with the detected causal variants and several pathways that were significantly over-represented by these genes, shedding light on their potential roles in prostate cancer development and progression.",2023,12,27
Discovery of the cereblon-recruiting tubulin PROTACs effective in overcoming Taxol resistance in vitro and in vivo.,"Overexpression of β3-tubulin is a common occurrence in human tumors and is associated with resistance to microtubule-targeting agents. PROTAC strategy has demonstrated significant potential in overcoming drug resistance. Herein, we report the discovery of W13 as the first PROTAC against tubulin, which was created by connecting a CRBN ligand to the widely recognized microtubule-destabilizing agent CA-4. Notably, it retains the inhibitory activity of the parental CA-4 and further exhibits substantial degradation of α/β/β3-tubulin in both A549 and A549/Taxol cell lines. The degradation of tubulin was subsequently verified to be mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Importantly, tumor xenograft research clearly showed W13's promising antitumor activity against human lung cancer. Taken together, the discovery of W13 demonstrated the practicality and feasibility of PROTAC targeting tubulin, hence establishing a potential therapeutic approach for treating NSCLC caused by the overexpression of β3-tubulin.",2023,12,27
Cornuside protects against ischemic stroke in rats by suppressing the IL-17F/TRAF6/NF-κB pathway via the brain-gut axis.,"Ischemic stroke is a serious neurological disease with limited therapeutic options; thus, it is particularly important to find effective treatments. Restoration of gut microflora diversity is an important factor in the treatment of ischemic stroke, but the mechanism remains unclear. Cornuside is known for its unique anti-inflammatory and circulation-promoting effects; however, whether it can effectively treat ischemic stroke and its therapeutic mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we used a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion model (MCAO/R) to mimic ischemic stroke in humans and to assess the cerebral protective effects of cornuside in rats with ischemic stroke. Using 16S rRNA sequencing and RNA sequencing, we explored the cornuside mechanism in the brain-gut axis that confers protection against ischemic stroke. In conclusion, cornuside can inhibit the IL-17F/TRAF6/NF-κB pathway by improving the dysregulation of intestinal microflora, and reduce intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation, which treated ischemic stroke rats.",2023,12,31
Influence of affective disorders on outcomes after suboccipital decompression for adult Chiari I malformation.,"Affective disorders (AD) have been shown to influence patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization across several pathologies, though this relationship has not been described in patients with Chiari I malformations (CM-I).

Can the gut microbiome inform the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation trials on cognition?,Most omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) supplementation clinical trials report inconsistent or null findings on measures of cognition or Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a relatively large variability in the response to n-3 PUFA supplementation. The purpose of this review is to identify whether the gut microbiome together with the metabolome can provide critical insights to understand this heterogeneity in the response to n-3 PUFA supplementation.,2023,12,26
Changes in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drive a succession of toxic and non-toxic strains of Microcystis blooms.,"The dynamic changes between toxic and non-toxic strains of Microcystis blooms have always been a hot topic. Previous studies have found that low CO<sub>2</sub> favors toxic strains, but how changing dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> (CO<sub>2</sub> [aq]) in water body influences the succession of toxic and non-toxic strains in Microcystis blooms remains uncertain. Here, we combined laboratory competition experiments, field observations, and a machine learning model to reveal the links between CO<sub>2</sub> changes and the succession. Laboratory experiments showed that under low CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (100-150 ppm), the toxic strains could make better use of CO<sub>2</sub> (aq) and be dominant. The non-toxic strains demonstrated a growth advantage as CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increased (400-1000 ppm). Field observations from June to November in Lake Taihu showed that the percentage of toxic strains increased as CO<sub>2</sub> (aq) decreased. Machine learning highlighted links between the inorganic carbon concentration and the proportion of advantageous strains. Our findings provide new insights for cyanoHABs prediction and prevention.",2023,12,22
The association of Changes In Depression Severity After The Onset of The Covid-19 Pandemic and Viral Non-Suppression Among People With HIV.,This study sought to characterize changes in depressive symptom severity during the COVID-19 pandemic and the association of these changes with HIV viral nonsuppression among people with HIV (PWH).,2023,12,29
Ambulatory Long Block: A Model of Precision Education and Assessment for Internal Medicine Residents.,"High-quality precision education (PE) aims to enhance outcomes for learners and society by incorporating longitudinal data and analytics to shape personalized learning strategies. However, existing educational data collection methods often suffer from fragmentation, leading to gaps in understanding learner and program performance. In this article, the authors present a novel approach to PE at the University of Cincinnati, focusing on the Ambulatory Long Block, a year-long continuous ambulatory group-practice experience. Over the last 17 years, the Ambulatory Long Block has evolved into a sophisticated data collection and analysis system that integrates feedback from various stakeholders, as well as learner self-assessment, electronic health record utilization information, and clinical throughput metrics. The authors detail their approach to data prioritization, collection, analysis, visualization, and feedback, providing a practical example of PE in action. This model has been associated with improvements in both learner performance and patient care outcomes. The authors also highlight the potential for real-time data review through automation and emphasize the importance of collaboration in advancing PE. Generalizable principles include designing learning environments with continuity as a central feature, gathering both quantitative and qualitative performance data from interprofessional assessors, using this information to supplement traditional workplace-based assessments, and pairing it with self-assessments. The authors advocate for criterion referencing over normative comparisons, using user-friendly data visualizations, and employing tailored coaching strategies for individual learners. The Ambulatory Long Block model underscores the potential of PE to drive improvements in medical education and health care outcomes.",2023,12,28
Expanding the role of chromosomal microarray analysis in the evaluation of recurrent pregnancy loss.,"Multiple factors contribute to recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). This review highlights the latest international guidelines for RPL workup, including immunological testing, by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE), and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG). These three societies recommend testing for antiphospholipid syndrome. ESHRE and RCOG also recommend thyroid peroxidase antibody testing, whereas ASRM does not. All guidelines advise against testing of natural killer cells, cytokines, antinuclear antibodies, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatibility, anti-HLA antibodies, and anti-sperm antibodies. However, when following ASRM, ESHRE or RCOG diagnostic guidelines, over 50% of cases have no identifiable cause. Genetic testing of products of conception (POC) can improve our understanding of unexplained RPL as aneuploidy is a common cause of RPL. Based on studies reporting results from chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) of POC, we propose a novel algorithm for RPL evaluation. The algorithm involves following evidence-based societal guidelines (published by ASRM, ESHRE, or RCOG), excluding parental karyotyping, in combination with CMA testing of miscarriage tissue. When utilizing this new evaluation algorithm, the number of unexplained cases of RPL decreases from over 50% to less than 10%. As a result, most patients are provided an explanation for their loss and healthcare costs are potentially reduced. Patients with an otherwise negative workup with euploid POC, are classified as ""truly unexplained RPL"". These patients are excellent candidates for enrollment in randomized, controlled trials examining novel immunological testing and treatment protocols.",2023,12,28
Structural optimization of a lysine demethylase 5 inhibitor for improvement of its cellular activity.,"Lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) subfamily proteins are important in epigenetic gene regulation. They are involved in the growth and drug resistance of cancer cells. Therefore, KDM5s are potential cancer therapeutic targets, and their inhibitors hold promise as anti-cancer drugs. Several KDM5 inhibitors, including KDM5-C49 (2a), have exhibited potent KDM5-inhibitory activities in in vitro enzyme assays. However, they do not show enough cellular activity despite being converted to their prodrugs. We hypothesized that their poor lipophilicity should prevent them from sufficiently penetrating the cell membrane, and introducing more lipophilic groups should improve cellular activities. In this study, we investigated 2a and KDM5-C70 (3a), a prodrug of 2a, and attempted to improve its cellular activity by replacing the N,N-dimethyl amino group of 3a with more lipophilic groups. N-Butyl, N-methyl amino compound 2e exhibited potent and selective KDM5-inhibitory activity equal to that of 2a. Furthermore, the cell membrane permeability of 3e, an ethyl ester prodrug of 2e, was six times higher than that of 3a in a parallel artificial membrane permeation assay. In addition, western blot analysis indicated that treating human lung cancer A549 cells with 3e increased histone methylation levels more strongly than that with 3a. Thus, we identified compound 3e as a more cell-active KDM5 inhibitor that has sufficient cell membrane permeability.",2023,12,27
"ZmB12D, a target of transcription factor ZmWRKY70, enhances the tolerance of Arabidopsis to submergence.","Submergence stress represents a serious threat to the yield and quality of maize because it can lead to oxygen deficiency and the accumulation of toxic metabolites. However, the mechanisms by which maize resists the adverse effects of submergence stress have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we cloned a gene from maize Balem (Barley aleurone and embryo), ZmB12D, which was expressed at significant levels in seed embryos during imbibition and in leaves under submergence stress. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that the ZmB12D protein was localized in the mitochondria. The overexpression of ZmB12D in increased the tolerance of Arabidopsis to submergence stress, probably due to a reduction in the levels of malonaldehyde (MDA), the increased activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD and CAT), enhanced electron transport by coordinating the expression of non-symbiotic hemoglobin-2 (AHb2) and Fe transport-related (AtNAS3) genes (mediating Fe and oxygen availability) and also modulated the anaerobic respiration rates through upregulated the AtPDC1, AtADH1, AtSUS4 genes under submergence. Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and transient transactivation assays demonstrated that ZmWRKY70 bound to the ZmB12D promoter and activated ZmB12D. Collectively, out findings indicate that ZmB12D plays an important role in the tolerance of maize to submergence stress. This research provides new insights into the genetic improvement of maize with regards to submergence tolerance.",2023,12,30
The Effect of Social Vulnerability on Initial Stage and Treatment for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a composite metric for social determinants of health.

Association of CD58 rs12044852 and rs2300747 polymorphisms with the risk of multiple sclerosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Multiple sclerosis is a serious neurodegenerative disorder that causes disability in young adults. Genetic predisposition of multiple sclerosis is well documented and several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the CD58 were found to be associated with this disease. This systematic review and meta-analysis were done with the aim of finding the association between CD58 gene SNPs (rs12044852 and rs2300747) and the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS).,2023,12,23
"Dioxins emissions from bio-medical waste incineration: A systematic review on emission factors, inventories, trends and health risk studies.","COVID-19 has aggravated the biomedical waste generation all over the world and the concern for its safe disposal is on the rise. The vast majority of healthcare systems employ incineration as their treatment method considering its agility to reduce the waste volume by up to 95-96% and high-temperature inactivation of infectious biological materials. However, incinerator emission is a significant contributor of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) according to various national inventories across the globe. Bio-Medical Waste Incinerators (BMWIs) are the dominant form of incinerator plants in developing nations and hence BMWI emissions were found to contribute lion's share of national dioxins inventories in most of these countries. The Stockholm Convention on POPs played a key role in imbibing significant urge on the dl-POPs monitoring studies of incinerators internationally and on controlling the average incinerator emission levels. Though many national/international agencies endorse a stringent incinerator stack emission standard of 0.1 ngTEQ/Nm<sup>3</sup>, there are some differences observed in nation-to-nation regulatory scenarios. This paper reviews and reports on the dioxins emission and health risk studies associated with bio-medical waste incineration over the last three decades (1990-2020) with a comprehensive spatial and temporal emission trend analysis. An overview of important national and international regulations, national inventories and emission factors for the biomedical waste incineration sector is also reviewed in detail. The study observes that continuous regulatory monitoring and logical relaxations can enhance the performance of the existing facilities ensuring low emissions and minimal risk.",2023,12,28

Characterization of the metabolites of Eucommiae Cortex in rats provides a further insight into its estrogen-like effective substances.,"Eucommiae Cortex is one of important traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) used in Asia for preventing and treating osteoporosis induced by estrogen deficiency. However, the low exposure of prototype components in Eucommiae Cortex in vivo is difficult to interpret its efficacy. Under the guidance of UPLC-Q/TOF-MS, 42 metabolites including 32 lignans and 10 phenolics, 21 of which were new compounds, were isolated from rat urine and feces after oral administration of aqueous extract of E. ulmoides Oliv. by various chromatographic techniques. Their structures were determined based on extensive physicochemical analyses and spectral data. Their absolute configurations were determined by experimental and calculated ECD spectra, along with the calculated NMR with DP4 evaluation. Additionally, all isolated metabolites were evaluated for their estrogen-like activities, and there are 15 metabolites having estrogen-like effects after assessing influences in MCF-7 cells. Further, Dual Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay was used to determine their activation with estrogen receptor, M10 and M11 mixtures, M14, M19, M33, M27, M31, M38-M41 could activate ERα, and M19 and M41 could activate ERβ. These results not only clarify the pharmacological substances of Eucommiae Cortex, but also provide a basis for guiding its clinical application.",2023,12,20
An ultrahigh-energy γ-ray bubble powered by a super PeVatron.,"We report the detection of a γ-ray bubble spanning at least 100deg<sup>2</sup> in ultra-high energy (UHE) up to a few PeV in the direction of the star-forming region Cygnus X, implying the presence super PeVatron(s) accelerating protons to at least 10 PeV. A log-parabola form with the photon index Γ(E)=(2.71±0.02)+(0.11±0.02)×log<sub>10</sub>(E/10TeV) is found fitting the gamma-ray energy spectrum of the bubble well. UHE sources, ""hot spots"" correlated with very massive molecular clouds, and a quasi-spherical amorphous γ-ray emitter with a sharp central brightening are observed in the bubble. In the core of ∼0.5°, spatially associating with a region containing massive OB association (Cygnus OB2) and a microquasar (Cygnus X-3), as well as previously reported multi-TeV sources, an enhanced concentration of UHE γ-rays is observed with 2 photons at energies above 1 PeV. The general feature of the bubble, the morphology, and the energy spectrum, are reasonably reproduced by the assumption of a particle accelerator in the core, continuously injecting protons into the ambient medium.",2023,12,23

First-line Management of Metastatic Urothelial Cancer: Current and Future Perspectives After the EV-302 and CheckMate-901 Studies.,"The standard of care for the first-line management of metastatic urothelial carcinoma has been recently challenged, with the combination of pembrolizumab and enfortumab vedotin (P-EV) strongly arising as a practice-changing option from classical platinum-based chemotherapies. With this paradigm shift on the horizon new questions, including the most suitable second line of treatment for these patients, and the role that the molecular characterization of these tumours will have when selecting these therapies will inevitably arise. Furthermore, after the negative results of the Keynote 361 and IMvigor 130 trials, the combination of nivolumab with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by nivolumab maintenance (Nivo GC-Nivo) has also shown positive results when compared with chemotherapy alone. Translational studies at a molecular, cellular, and functional level will be key to better explain these discordant results. In this Current Perspective, we discuss the potential impact of these results in clinical practice and propose specific guidance for prospective translational research.",2023,12,13
"On the role of memory in misinformation corrections: Repeated exposure, correction durability, and source credibility.","Misinformation can negatively affect cognition, beliefs, and behavior, and thus contribute to societal disruption. Correcting misinformation can counteract these effects by updating memory and beliefs. In this selective review, we highlight recent perspectives on and evidence for the role of memory in the efficacy of correction methods. Two theoretical accounts propose that repeating misinformation can impair or improve correction efficacy to the extent that familiarity or integrative encoding prevails. We summarize evidence that recollection of corrections can counteract potential interference from misinformation repetitions on memory and belief updating. The efficacy of such updating also declines over time, especially when misinformation sources are not remembered. We call for more research on the role of memory in everyday misinformation corrections to better understand interactions among these processes.",2023,12,12
The integration of TRX/GRX systems and phytohormonal signalling pathways in plant stress and development.,"Plant acclimation to changing environmental conditions involves the interaction of different signalling molecules, including reactive oxygen species and hormones. Redox regulation exerted by thioredoxin (TRX) and glutaredoxin (GRX), two oxidoreductases, is emerging as a specific point of control mediating signal transduction pathways associated with plant growth and stress response. Phytohormones are messengers that coordinate plant cell activities to regulate growth, defence, and productivity, although their cross-talk with components of the redox system is less known. The present review focuses on our current knowledge of the interplay that occurs between TRX and GRX systems and phytohormonal signalling pathways in connection with the control of plant development and stress responses. Here, we consider the regulation that phytohormones exert on TRX and GRX systems, as well as the involvement of these redox proteins in the control of phytohormone-mediated signalling pathways.",2023,12,23
Histone Trimethylations and HDAC5 Regulate Spheroid Subpopulation and Differentiation Signaling of Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells.,"Human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have shown immense potential for regenerative medicine. Our previous work demonstrated that chitosan nano-deposited surfaces induce spheroid formation and differentiation of ASCs for treating sciatic nerve injuries. However, the underlying cell fate and differentiation mechanisms of ASC-derived spheroids remain unknown. Here, we investigate the epigenetic regulation and signaling coordination of these therapeutic spheroids. During spheroid formation, we observed significant increases in histone 3 trimethylation at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), lysine 9 (H3K9me3), and lysine 27 (H3K27me3), accompanied by increased histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities and decreased histone acetyltransferase activities. Additionally, HDAC5 translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, along with increased nuclear HDAC5 activities. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we analyzed the chitosan-induced ASC spheroids and discovered distinct cluster subpopulations, cell fate trajectories, differentiation traits, and signaling networks using the 10x Genomics platform, R studio/language, and the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool. Specific subpopulations were identified within the spheroids that corresponded to a transient reprogramming state (Cluster 6) and the endpoint cell state (Cluster 3). H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 were discovered as key epigenetic regulators by IPA to initiate stem cell differentiation in Cluster 6 cells, and confirmed by qPCR and their respective histone methyltransferase inhibitors: SNDX-5613 (a KMT2A inhibitor for H3K4me3) and SUVi (an SUV39H1 inhibitor for H3K9me3). Moreover, H3K9me3 and HDAC5 were involved in regulating downstream signaling and neuronal markers during differentiation in Cluster 3 cells. These findings emphasize the critical role of epigenetic regulation, particularly H3K4me3, H3K9me3, and HDAC5, in shaping stem cell fate and directing lineage-specific differentiation.",2023,12,30
How a Team Effectiveness Approach to Health Systems Science Can Illuminate Undergraduate Medical Education Outcomes.,"Health care delivery requires physicians to operate in teams to successfully navigate complexity in caring for patients and communities. The importance of training physicians early in core concepts of working in teams (i.e., ""teaming"") has long been established. Over the past decade, however, little evidence of team effectiveness training for medical students has been available. The recent introduction of health systems science as a third pillar of medical education provides an opportunity to teach and prepare students to work in teams and achieve related core competencies across the medical education continuum and health care delivery settings. Although educators and health care system leaders have emphasized the teaching and learning of team-based care, conceptual models and evidence that inform effective teaming within all aspects of undergraduate medical education (including classroom, clinical, and community settings) are needed to advance the science regarding learning and working in teams. Anchoring teaming through the core foundational theory of team effectiveness and its operational components could catalyze the empirical study of medical student teams, uncover modifiable factors that lead to the evidence for improved student learning, and improve the link among competency-based assessments between undergraduate medical education to graduate medical education. In this article, authors articulate several implications for medical schools through 5 conceptual areas: admissions, the design and teaching of team effectiveness in health systems science curricula, the related competency-based assessments and course and program evaluations. The authors then discuss the relevance of the measurable components and intended outcomes to team effectiveness in undergraduate medical education as critical to successfully prepare students for teaming in clerkships and eventually residency and clinical practice.",2023,12,28
"Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of 2-(naphthalen-1-yloxy)-N-phenylacetamide derivatives as TRPM4 inhibitors for the treatment of prostate cancer.","Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) is considered to be a potential target for cancer and other human diseases. Herein, a series of 2-(naphthalen-1-yloxy)-N-phenylacetamide derivatives were designed and synthesized as new TRPM4 inhibitors, aiming to improve cellular potency. One of the most promising compounds, 7d (ZX08903), displayed promising antiproliferative activity against prostate cancer cell lines. 7d also suppressed colony formation and the expression of androgen receptor (AR) protein in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, 7d can concentration-dependently induce cell apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Collectively, these findings indicated that compound 7d may serve as a promising lead compound for further anticancer drug development.",2023,12,28
Design of fluorinated stealth poly(ε-caprolactone) nanocarriers.,"The covalent functionalization of polymers with fluorinated moieties represents a promising strategy for the development of multimodal systems. Moreover, polymer fluorination often endows the resulting nanocarriers with improved colloidal stability in the biological environment. In this work, we developed fluorinated pegylated (PEG) biodegradable poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) drug nanocarriers showing both high colloidal stability and stealth properties, as well as being (<sup>19</sup>F)-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) detectable. The optimized nanocarriers were obtained mixing a PEG-PCL block copolymer with a nonafluoro-functionalized PCL polymer. The role of PEGylation and fluorination on self-assembly and colloidal behavior of the obtained nanoparticles (NPs) was investigated, as well as their respective role on stealth properties and colloidal stability. To prove the feasibility of the developed NPs as potential <sup>19</sup>F NMR detectable drug delivery systems, a hydrophobic drug was successfully encapsulated, and the maintenance of the relevant <sup>19</sup>F NMR properties evaluated. Drug-loaded fluorinated NPs still retained a sharp and intense <sup>19</sup>F NMR signal and good relaxivity parameters (i.e., T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> relaxation times) in water, which were not impaired by drug encapsulation.",2023,12,26
Abortion Care After the Dobbs Decision: An Academic Health System's Response to a Statewide Ban.,"Indiana was the first state to pass legislation severely restricting access to abortion care following the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. Indiana Senate Enrolled Act 1 (SEA 1) outlaws all abortions with few exceptions. Indiana University Health (IU Health), the largest and only academic health system in the state, has a unique relationship with the Indiana University School of Medicine and a vision to improve the health of Indiana residents. IU Health employed the Hospital Incident Command System model to create a plan to ensure its patients continue to have access to safe, high-quality family planning, maternal, and neonatal care services and that clinicians are protected against criminal penalties and threats to personal safety. This article provides an overview of the Incident Command structure used to rapidly work across many disciplines, tackle complex issues, respond to concerns, and design and implement changes. The article also outlines the key considerations and decisions made by Incident Command leaders, such as where abortions that met the new law's criteria should be performed, changes to clinical workflows and protocols, and the creation of a rapid response team. The article then examines the operational, legal, and clinical challenges encountered by clinicians and health care team members, including a lack of peer support or idea sharing with other health systems in the state; accurate estimation of abortion, live birth, and neonatal intensive care unit volumes; and ambiguity in the law and lack of guidance from the state government. Recommendations regarding communication with clinicians and other health care team members and engaging information technology early are offered for health systems and medical schools that may face legislative barriers to health care delivery in the future. Finally, IU Health's commitment to tracking the impact of SEA 1 on patients, clinicians, employees, and the state is outlined.",2023,12,28

Phase to phase: Navigating drug combinations with hypomethylating agents in higher-risk MDS trials for optimal outcomes.,"Recent developments in high-risk Myelodysplastic Neoplasms (HR MDS) treatment are confronted with challenges in study design due to evolving drug combinations with Hypomethylating Agents (HMAs). The shift from the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) to its molecular revision (IPSS-M) has notably influenced research and clinical practice. Introducing concepts like the MDS/AML overlap complicate classifications and including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in MDS studies introduces another layer of complexity. The International Consortium for MDS emphasizes aligning HR MDS criteria with the 2022 ELN criteria for AML. Differences in advancements between AML and MDS treatments and hematological toxicity in HR MDS underline the importance of detailed trial designs. Effective therapeutic strategies require accurate reporting of adverse events, highlighting the need for clarity in criteria like the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). We provide an overview on negative clinical trials in HR MDS, analyze possible reasons and explore possibilities to optimize future clinical trials in this challenging patient population.",2023,12,19
Microbial functional heterogeneity induced in a petroleum-polluted soil profile.,"Microbial taxonomic diversity declines with increasing stress caused by petroleum pollution. However, few studies have tested whether functional diversities vary similarly to taxonomic diversity along the stress gradient. Here, we investigated soil microbial communities in a petrochemically polluted site in China. Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentrations were higher in the middle (2-3 m) and deep soil layer (3-5 m) than in the surface soil layer (0-2 m). Accordingly, microbial taxonomic α-diversity was decreased by 44% (p < 0.001) in the middle and deep soil layers, compared to the surface soil layer. In contrast, functional α-diversity decreased by 3% (p < 0.001), showing a much better buffering capacity to environmental stress. Differences in microbial taxonomic and functional β-diversities were enlarged in the middle and deep soil layers, extending the Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) that a community adapts to stressful environments in its own way. Consistent with the stress gradient hypothesis, we revealed a higher degree of network connectivity among microbial species and genes in the middle and deep soil layers compared to the surface soil layer. Together, we demonstrate that microbial functionality is more tolerant to stress than taxonomy, both of which were amenable to AKP and the stress gradient hypothesis.",2023,12,29
The competitive and selective adsorption of heavy metals by struvite in the Pb(II)-Cd(II)-Zn(II) composite system and its environmental significance.,"The prevalence of struvite and other phosphate minerals in eutrophic environments has a significant effect on the transport and transformation of environmental heavy metals, but their competitive immobilization characteristics and mechanisms for heavy metals remain unclear. Three different sources of struvite (BS, CSHS, and CSS) were obtained respectively by biosynthesis and chemical synthesis with or without humic acid to investigate their competitive immobilization characteristics and mechanism of heavy metals in the Pb(II)-Cd(II)-Zn(II) composite system. The results showed that the immobilization of heavy metals by struvite is physico-chemical adsorption and the affinity (in descending order) is Pb(II) >> Cd(II)/Zn(II). Cd(II) promotes the immobilization of Pb(II)/Zn(II) by BS. The order of the selective strength by struvite for Pb(II) is BS >> CSS ≈ CSHS. The study indicates that the difference between struvite holding heavy metal ions is related to the material composition and heavy metal types, and BS shows best selective immobilization for Pb(II) in the Pb(II)-Cd(II)-Zn(II) composite system. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the environmental geochemical role and eco-environmental effects of struvite.",2023,12,28
The Case for Advocacy Curricula and Opportunities in Medical Education: Past Examples to Inform Future Instruction.,"With recent advances in understanding racial, socioeconomic, and mental health issues in medicine and their relation to policy and legislation, medical professionals are increasingly involved in local and national advocacy efforts. At the frontlines of these initiatives are medical students who, in addition to completing required coursework and clinical training, devote themselves to serving patients through civic participation. The burgeoning evidence concerning health care disparities and inequity, along with greater awareness of racial and socioeconomic discrimination, have made advocacy an essential aspect of many students' medical training. Every year, thousands of medical students join national medical advocacy organizations, in addition to regional, state, and local groups. Despite the rich history of medical student involvement in advocacy, there remains much speculation and skepticism about the practice as an essential component of the medical profession. From early initiatives pushing for national health insurance after World War II to encouraging anti-discrimination policies and practices, medical students have been collectively working to create change for themselves and their patients. Through efforts such as banning smoking on airplanes, creating safe syringe programs, and protesting against police brutality, many medical students work tirelessly in advocacy despite minimal educational support or guidance about the advocacy process. Given that medical student advocacy continues to grow and has shown measurable successes in the past, the authors believe that these efforts should be rewarded and expanded upon. The authors examine historical examples of medical student advocacy to suggest ways in which advocacy can be integrated into core medical school curricula and activities. They call attention to opportunities to support students' development of knowledge and skills to facilitate legislative change, expansion of interprofessional collaborations and credit, and curricular updates to promote social and health equity.",2023,12,28
Overexpression of LINC00853 enhances tumorigenesis and metastasis of gastric cancer.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is a rising global health issue, with increasing incidence and mortality rates. The pathogenesis of GC is highly complex and involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therefore, identifying new genes and pathways that contribute to the development and progression of GC is essential for improving diagnosis and treatment outcomes. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as a promising area of research in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying various cancers, including GC. These RNA molecules are longer than 200 nucleotides and do not code proteins. Although initially considered ""junk DNA"", lncRNAs have been demonstrated to play significant roles in various biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, as well as in the pathogenesis of various cancers. In this study, we screened clinical specimens for a novel lncRNA, LINC00853, which showed high expression in GC tissues and promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed its ability to facilitate the growth and metastasis of GC. These results suggest that LINC00853 plays a crucial role in the development and progression of GC.",2023,12,28
Arm Swing while Walking and Running: A New Clinical Feature to Separate Parkinson's Disease from Functional Parkinsonism.,"Functional parkinsonism is an important differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD).

"The role of immune inflammation in electroconvulsive therapy for schizophrenia: Treatment mechanism, and relationship with clinical efficacy: Immune-inflammation in ECT for schizophrenia.","Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder that has detrimental effects on a significant portion of the global population. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), as a safe and effective physical therapy for schizophrenia, has demonstrated the ability to rapidly improve both positive and negative symptoms. Despite being used to treat schizophrenia for over 80 years, the therapeutic mechanisms of ECT are still in the early stages of exploration. Evidence has suggested that immune inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia by interacting with neurotransmitters, neurodevelopment, and neurodegeneration. Given the importance of ECT as a fast-acting physical therapy for schizophrenia, gaining a deeper understanding of the role of immune inflammation may lead to developing innovative therapeutic approaches. This review summarized existing research that examined changes in peripheral inflammation following ECT in schizophrenia patients, and the effects of electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS) on neuroinflammation in animal studies.",2023,12,31
[Research progress of associations between dental caries and systemic diseases].,"Dental caries is a bacteria-mediated, multifactorial, chronic progressive disease that results in the phasic demineralization and remineralization of dental hard tissues. In recent years, amounts of studies have focused on the association between dental caries and systemic diseases. This paper reviews the researches about associations between caries and systemic diseases. An electronic search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science for articles published from 2003 to 2022 in the English language. Studies were included in the following ten categories of systemic diseases: cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, respiratory diseases, autoimmune rheumatic diseases, neurologic diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, kidney diseases, skin diseases, iron deficiency anaemia and tumors. This review discusses the relationship between dental caries and systemic diseases, as well as the potentially involved mechanisms, providing new ideas for disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies for dentists and other clinicians.",2023,12,29
[Research progress on the performance of clear aligner attachment materials].,"For most patients undergoing clear aligner treatment, it could be necessary to bond multiple attachments on their tooth surfaces. The clear aligner attachment is designed to enhance aligner retention, transmit orthodontic forces, and make the programmed tooth movement more predictable. Materials such as restorative resin, orthodontic bonding adhesive, flowable resin, and resin-modified glass ionomer cement are currently used for attachment bonding. But there is currently no conclusion as to which material suits most. The objective of this review is to look into the studies published in recent years, in order to explore the optimal material option for making clear aligner attachments.",2023,12,29
"Defining optimal dietary starch, oil, and amino acid inclusion levels for broilers experiencing a coccidiosis challenge.","Alternative methods to alleviate coccidiosis in broilers are of interest to producers, including dietary strategies to minimize disruptions in growth rate and efficiency when faced with health challenges. Our objective was to determine optimal combinations of dietary starch, amino acids (AA), and oil to benefit productivity of broilers experiencing Eimeria-induced immune activation. Two trials were conducted using 1,536 male Ross 308 broiler chicks in floor pens randomly assigned to 1 of 17 experimental treatments. All birds received common starter (d 0-10) and finisher (d 24-35) diets, and only differed based on their assigned experimental grower diet (d 10-24). Trial 1 experimental grower diets ranged from 2,700 to 3,300 kcal/kg AME. Trial 2 included 10 experimental grower diets following a simplex lattice design consisting of 3 basal lots formulated to have the highest starch (45.4%), oil (10.2%), or AA density (120, 1.33% digestible Lys) and mixed in 4 equally spaced levels for each component (0, 0.33, 0.67, 1). These mixtures enabled varying densities of AA (80-120% of recommendation), starch:oil (4:1-20:1), and AME (2,940-3,450 kcal/kg). Bird and feeder weights were collected on d 0, 10, 24, and 35, and birds were exposed to an Eimeria challenge on d 11 or 12. In trial 2, excreta samples were collected for AME determination and carcasses were processed on d 36. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, t test, or regression. In Trial 1, BW gain and feed conversion were improved (P < 0.05) by increasing dietary AME. In Trial 2, birds receiving diets containing AA at 93 to 107% of recommendations and higher oil exhibited improved (P < 0.05) performance, but increased starch at the expense of oil reduced performance (P < 0.05). Relative breast and fat pad weights were not influenced by diet in Trial 2. We determined that broilers mildly challenged with Eimeria would exhibit highest BW gain when receiving diets containing 35.8% starch, 8.9% oil, and 101.3% of AA recommendations, which can be utilized by producers to maintain productivity under health-challenged conditions.",2023,12,01

LncRNA STAT3-AS regulates endometrial receptivity via the STAT3 signaling pathway.,"Endometrial receptivity is critical for the successful establishment of pregnancy in ruminants. Interferon tau (IFNT) plays a key role in promoting embryo attachment by activating the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway, which induces the expression of a series of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). In our previous study, sequencing analysis of goat endometrial epithelial cells (gEECs) treated with 20 ng/mL IFNT revealed a differentially expressed long non-coding RNA located on the STAT3 antisense chain, which we designated STAT3-AS. The aim of this study was to investigate the role and mechanism of STAT3-AS in establishing endometrial receptivity in goats. The results showed that STAT3-AS was expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of gEECs, and its expression increased significantly in the uterus on day 15 of pregnancy. STAT3-AS expression was upregulated in gEECs treated with IFNT alone or in combination with progesterone and estradiol. Knockdown of STAT3-AS using specific short interfering RNA significantly inhibited the expression of classical ISGs such as interferon-stimulated gene 15 and 2',5'-oligodenylate synthetase 2, as well as uterine endometrial receptivity-related genes including homeobox gene A11, integrin beta 3, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Moreover, gEEC proliferation and the STAT3 pathway were suppressed in the absence of STAT3-AS. However, pretreatment with the STAT3 activator RO8191 restored the effect of silencing STAT3-AS on endometrial receptivity. Overall, these results suggest that STAT3-AS is an important regulator of endometrial receptivity in goats and that it regulates endometrial receptivity through the STAT3 pathway.",2023,12,29
Targeting noncoding RNAs to reactivate or eliminate latent HIV reservoirs.,Expression of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) is more tissue and cell type-specific than expression of protein-coding genes.

"Modifying the antiviral innate immune response by selective writing, erasing, and reading of m<sup>6</sup>A on viral and cellular RNA.","Viral infection and the antiviral innate immune response are regulated by the RNA modification m<sup>6</sup>A. m<sup>6</sup>A directs nearly all aspects of RNA metabolism by recruiting RNA-binding proteins that mediate the fate of m<sup>6</sup>A-containing RNA. m<sup>6</sup>A controls the antiviral innate immune response in diverse ways, including shielding viral RNA from detection by antiviral sensors and influencing the expression of cellular mRNAs encoding antiviral signaling proteins, cytokines, and effector proteins. While m<sup>6</sup>A and the m<sup>6</sup>A machinery are important for the antiviral response, the precise mechanisms that determine how the m<sup>6</sup>A machinery selects specific viral or cellular RNA molecules for modification during infection are not fully understood. In this review, we highlight recent findings that shed light on how viral infection redirects the m<sup>6</sup>A machinery during the antiviral response. A better understanding of m<sup>6</sup>A targeting during viral infection could lead to new immunomodulatory and therapeutic strategies against viral infection.",2023,12,21
Comparative efficacy of various pharmacologic treatments for alcohol withdrawal syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"This study was to compare multiple classes of medications and medication combinations to find alternatives or additives for patients not applicable to benzodiazepines (BZDs). We performed a network meta-analysis to assess the comparative effect of 11 pharmacologic treatments in patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Forty-one studies were included, comprising a total sample size of 4187 participants. The pooled results from the randomized controlled trials showed that there was no significant difference in the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment-Alcohol, revised (CIWA-Ar) reduction with other medications or medication combinations compared to BZDs. Compared to BZDs, the mean difference in ICU length of stay of anticonvulsants + BZDs was -1.71 days (95% CI = -2.82, -0.59). Efficacy rankings from cohort studies showed that anticonvulsant + BZDs were superior to other treatments in reducing CIWA-Ar scores and reducing the length of stay in the ICU. Synthesis results from randomized controlled trials indicate that there are currently no data suggesting that other medications or medication combinations can fully replace BZDs. However, synthetic results from observational studies have shown that BZDs are effective in the context of adjuvant anticonvulsant therapy, particularly with early use of gabapentin in combination with BZDs in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which represents a promising treatment option.",2023,12,27
A comprehensive review of small molecules targeting PI3K pathway: Exploring the structural development for the treatment of breast cancer.,"Cancer stands as one of the deadliest diseases, ranking second in terms of its global impact. Despite the presence of numerous compelling theories concerning its origins, none have succeeded in fully elucidating the intricate nature of this ailment. Among the prevailing concerns in today's world, breast cancer proliferation remains a significant issue, particularly affecting females. The abnormal proliferation of the PI3K pathway emerges as a prominent driver of breast cancer, underscoring its role in cellular survival and proliferation. Consequently, targeting this pathway has emerged as a leading strategy in breast cancer therapeutics. Within this context, the present article explores the current landscape of anti-tumour drug development, focusing on structural activity relationships (SAR) in PI3K targeting breast cancer treatment. Notably, certain moieties like triazines, pyrimidine, quinazoline, quinoline, and pyridoxine have been explored as potential PI3K inhibitors for combating breast cancer. Various heterocyclic small molecules are undergoing clinical trials, such as Alpelisib, the first orally available FDA-approved drug targeting PI3K; others include buparlisib, pictilisib, and taselisib, which inhibit class I PI3K. These drugs are used for the treatment of breast cancer but still have various side effects with their high cost. Therefore, the primary goal of this review is to include all current advances in the development of anticancer medicines that target PI3K over-activation in the treatment of breast cancer.",2023,12,30
Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography based method for simultaneous determination of purines and their derivatives in food spices.,"This work presents method for separation and quantification of adenine, guanine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, uric acid, and creatinine in food spices using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with UV detection. Optimized conditions allowed separation with mobile phases containing acetonitrile and additives ammonium acetate (90:10, v/v, pH 6.1) or formate (90:10, v/v, pH 3.2). In food spices no uric acid was detected, creatinine (16 ± 2 μg g<sup>-1</sup>) was found only in instant dried yeast. The highest content of purines was determined in dried yeast (xanthine 110 ± 8 μg g<sup>-1</sup>, hypoxanthine 441 ± 24 μg g<sup>-1</sup>, adenine 84 ± 16 μg g<sup>-1</sup>, guanine 163 ± 12 μg g<sup>-1</sup>), high in curry, herbal pepper, and chicken seasoning, the lowest concentration was in black pepper (hypoxanthine 12 ± 2 μg g<sup>-1</sup>, adenine 27 ± 3 μg g<sup>-1</sup>).

Elucidating the efficacy of functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube in the biogenesis of L-Dopa and antioxidant metabolites in cell cultures of Hybanthus enneaspermus.,"Hybanthus enneaspermus (L.)F.Muell. is a highly indispensable medicinal herb yielding L-Dopa, deemed the gold standard drug among the therapeutic options for Parkinson's disease. This investigation is the first attempt to evaluate the eliciting influence of carboxylic acid functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT-COOH) on the biosynthesis of L-Dopa and on biomass aggregation and antioxidant metabolites in H. enneaspermus cell suspension cultures. Suspension cells were accomplished from friable calli generated from the nodal segments of H. enneaspermus in Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid medium infused with 2 mg L<sup>-1</sup> 2, 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D), and 0.3 mg L<sup>-1</sup>meta-Topolin (mT). The influence of MWCNTs on L-Dopa synthesis, biomass accumulation, and biochemical parameters was examined on the basis of the exposure time and in a concentration-dependent manner of MWCNTs. The inclusion of 30 mg L<sup>-1</sup> MWCNTs increased the biomass and the L-Dopa level by 2.00 and 16.37-folds, respectively, compared with that of the control. Furthermore, the effect of MWCNTs on physiological parameters such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, 2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) was examined over the elicited cells. Among the antioxidant enzymatic activities, CAT enhanced 8.0 fold compared with that of the control. MDA and DPPH content enhanced 2.60 and 1.12 folds, respectively, compared with that of the control. The current study showed that MWCNTs offer new possibilities for their usage over in vitro by acting as potential innovative plant metabolite elicitors and stress-protecting entities.",2023,12,29
[Mitigating metal artifacts in cone-beam CT images through deep learning techniques].,"<b>Objective:</b> To develop and evaluate metal artifact removal systems (MARSs) based on deep learning to assess their effectiveness in removing artifacts caused by different thicknesses of metals in cone-beam CT (CBCT) images. <b>Methods:</b> A full-mouth standard model (60 mm×75 mm×110 mm) was three-dimensional (3D) printed using photosensitive resin. The model included a removable and replaceable target tooth position where cobalt-chromium alloy crowns with varying thicknesses were inserted to generate matched CBCT images. The artifacts resulting from cobalt-chromium alloys with different thicknesses were evaluated using the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). CNN-MARS and U-net-MARS were developed using a convolutional neural network and U-net architecture, respectively. The effectiveness of both MARSs were assessed through visualization and by measuring SSIM and PSNR values. The SSIM and PSNR values were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (α=0.05). <b>Results:</b> Significant differences were observed in the range of artifacts produced by different thicknesses of cobalt-chromium alloys (all <i>P</i><0.05), with 1 mm resulting in the least artifacts. The SSIM values for specimens with thicknesses of 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, and 2.0 mm were 0.916±0.019, 0.873±0.010, and 0.833±0.010, respectively (<i>F</i>=447.89, <i>P</i><0.001). The corresponding PSNR values were 20.834±1.176, 17.002±0.427, and 14.673±0.429, respectively (<i>F</i>=796.51, <i>P</i><0.001). After applying CNN-MARS and U-net-MARS to artifact removal, the SSIM and PSNR values significantly increased for images with the same thickness of metal (both <i>P</i><0.05). When using the CNN-MARS for artifact removal, the SSIM values for 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mm were 0.938±0.023, 0.930±0.029, and 0.928±0.020 (<i>F</i>=2.22, <i>P</i>=0.112), while the PSNR values were 30.938±1.495, 30.578±2.154 and 30.553±2.355 (<i>F</i>=0.54, <i>P</i>=0.585). When using the U-net-MARS for artifact removal, the SSIM values for 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mm were 0.930±0.024, 0.932±0.017 and 0.930±0.012 (<i>F</i>=0.24, <i>P</i>=0.788), and the PSNR values were 30.291±0.934, 30.351±1.002 and 30.271±1.143 (<i>F</i>=0.07, <i>P</i>=0.929). No significant differences were found in SSIM and PSNR values after artifact removal using CNN-MARS and U-net-MARS for different thicknesses of cobalt-chromium alloys (all <i>P</i>>0.05). Visualization demonstrated a high degree of similarity between the images before and after artifact removal using both MARSs. However, CNN-MARS displayed clearer metal edges and preserved more tissue details when compared with U-net-MARS. <b>Conclusions:</b> Both the CNN-MARS and U-net-MARS models developed in this study effectively remove the metal artifacts and enhance the image quality. CNN-MARS exhibited an advantage in restoring tissue structure information around the artifacts compared to U-net-MARS.",2023,12,29
Rhabdomyolysis during adjunctive treatment with cariprazine in a clozapine-resistant schizophrenia patient.,"We report the case of a 49-year-old male treatment-resistant schizophrenia patient, whose treatment with clozapine and sertraline was supplemented with cariprazine 1.5 mg/day while regularly presenting for electroconvulsive therapy. After 3 weeks of adjunctive treatment with cariprazine, blood tests revealed pronounced signs of rhabdomyolysis, including a creatine kinase serum level of 20 386 U/L and an AST serum level of 696 U/L. Clinically, the patient did not report somatic symptoms other than mild back pain. After discontinuation of cariprazine and normal saline infusion, the above-mentioned findings resolved rapidly. Although very rare, rhabdomyolysis can be a potentially dangerous side effect of cariprazine and clinicians should be aware of its possible occurrence.",2023,12,27
Fabrication of magnetic Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> doped β-cyclodextrin microporous organic network for the efficient extraction of endocrine disrupting chemicals from food takeaway boxes.,"Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are a typical class of natural or man-made endogenous hormone agonists or antagonists that can directly or potentially interfere with human endocrine system. However, it is still difficult to analyze trace EDCs directly from complex environment and food matrices. Therefore, the proper sample pretreatment is highly desired and the preparation of efficient adsorbents is of great challenge and importance. Herein, we report the facile one-pot solvothermal synthesis of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticle doped magnetic β-cyclodextrin microporous organic network composites (MCD-MONs) for the magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) of four phenolic EDCs in water and food takeaway boxes prior to the high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. The sheet-like Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> doped MCD-MONs offered good magnetic property (16.5 emu g<sup>-1</sup>) and stability, and provided numerous hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, π-π, and host-guest interaction sites for EDCs. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the established method was successfully verified with wide linear range (2.0-1000 µg L<sup>-1</sup>), low limits of detection (0.6-1.0 µg L<sup>-1</sup>), good precisions (intra-day and inter-day RSDs < 5.2 %, n = 3), large enrichment factors (88-98) and adsorption capacity (90.3-255.8 mg g<sup>-1</sup>), short extraction time (6 min), less adsorbent consumption (3 mg), and good reusability (at least 8 times) for EDCs. The proposed method was successfully applied to detect the trace EDCs in real samples with the recovery of 84.0-99.7 %. This work demonstrated the great potential of MCD-MONs for the efficient MSPE of trace EDCs from complex food takeaway boxes and water samples and uncovered the prospect of CD-based MONs in sample pretreatment.",2023,12,30
Effect of Various Ancillary Operating Room Techniques on Wound Healing Outcomes After Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"The successful management of wound healing following total hip arthroplasty (THA) is multifaceted, relying on various intraoperative techniques and surgical variables. Recent reviews have evaluated many of these factors, including the comparison between mesh-adhesive dressings and other skin closure methods, the closing time of different suture techniques, and the four aspects of closure for THA (deep fascial layer; subdermal layer; intradermal layer). However, previous articles did not cover certain topics that can be directly influenced by the surgeon. Specifically, these include the use of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, the management of intraoperative drains, and the selection of surgical approaches. Therefore, in this comprehensive systematic review of the literature, we have focused on three factors that may influence wound healing. We evaluated the following: (1) the impact of different DVT prophylaxis methods on wound healing and infection rates; (2) the effects of intraoperative drain use on wound healing; (3) the influence of various surgical approaches on wound closure, and postoperative infection rates. By concentrating on these areas, this review aims to provide a more complete understanding of the factors that contribute to successful wound management after THA.",2023,12,29
Targeted mutagenesis of BnTTG1 homologues generated yellow-seeded rapeseed with increased oil content and seed germination under abiotic stress.,"Yellow seed is one desirable trait with great potential to improve seed oil quality and yield. The present study surveys the redundant role of BnTTG1 genes in the proanthocyanidins (PA) biosynthesis, oil content and abiotic stress resistance. Stable yellow seed mutants were generated after mutating BnTTG1 by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system. Yellow seed phenotype could be obtained only when both functional homologues of BnTTG1 were simultaneously knocked out. Homozygous mutants of BnTTG1 homologues showed decreased thickness and PA accumulation in seed coat. Transcriptome and qRT-PCR analysis indicated that BnTTG1 mutation inhibited the expression of genes involved in phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways. Increased seed oil content and alteration of fatty acid (FA) composition were observed in homozygous mutants of BnTTG1 with enriched expression of genes involved in FA biosynthesis pathway. In addition, target mutation of BnTTG1 accelerated seed germination rate under salt and cold stresses. Enhanced seed germination capacity in BnTTG1 mutants was correlated with the change of expression level of ABA responsive genes. Overall, this study elucidated the redundant role of BnTTG1 in regulating seed coat color and established an efficient approach for generating yellow-seeded oilseed rape genetic resources with increase oil content, modified FA composition and resistance to multiple abiotic stresses.",2023,12,22
Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of acaricide resistance in Rhipicephalus microplus field isolates from South Africa and Brazil.,"Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus is one of the most successful ticks infesting cattle around the world. This highly-invasive species transmits cattle parasites that cause cattle fever leading to a high socio-economic burden. Tick eradication programs have often failed, due to the development of acaricide resistance. Here we characterize acaricide resistance in a large number of tick isolates from regions in South Africa (KwaZulu Natal, Mpumalanga, Western & Eastern Cape provinces) and two Brazilian regions. By means of Larval Packet Tests (LPT's) acaricide resistance was evaluated against five commonly used acaricides (chlorfenvinphos, fipronil, deltamethrin, amitraz, and ivermectin). Furthermore, the coding region containing the knock down resistance (kdr) mutation, known to result in pyrethroid resistance, was sequenced. Resistance to at least one acaricide class was reported in each of the five regions, and a high proportion of tick isolates exhibited multi-resistance to at least two acaricide classes (range: 22.2-80.0%). Furthermore, resistance ratios (RR) showed high spatial variation (intercontinental, as well as regional) but low regional spatial autocorrelation. Previous and current acaricide use correlated with current RR, and several combinations of acaricide RR were positively correlated. Moreover, fipronil resistance tended to be higher in farms with more intense acaricide use. The kdr-mutations provided the ticks a fitness advantage under the selection pressure of synthetic pyrethroids based on population (kdr-allele frequency) and individual level data (genotypes). The data show the threat of acaricide (multi-)resistance is high in Brazil and South Africa, but acaricide specific levels need to be assessed locally. For this purpose, gathering complementary molecular information on mutations that underlie resistance can reduce costs and expedite necessary actions. In an era of human-caused habitat alterations, implementing molecular data-driven programs becomes essential in overcoming tick-induced socio-economic losses.",2023,12,27
Tumor neoantigens derived from RNA editing events show significant clinical relevance in melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy.,"This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of RNA editing (RE) and RNA editing derived (RED-) neoantigens in melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy. Vardict and VEP were used to identify the somatic mutations. RE events were identified by Reditools2 and filtered by the custom pipeline. miRTar2GO was implemented to predict the RE whether located in miRNA targets within the 3' UTR region. NetMHCpan and NetCTLpan were used to identify and characterize RED-neoantigens. In total, 7116 RE events were identified, most of which were A-to-I events. Using our custom pipeline, 631 RED-neoantigens were identified that show a significantly greater peptide-MHC affinity, and facilitate epitope processing and presentation than wild-type peptides. The OS of the patients with high RED-neoantigens burden was significantly longer (P = 0.035), and a significantly higher RED-neoantigens burden was observed in responders (P = 0.048). The area under the curve of the RED-neoantigen was 0.831 of OS. Then, we validated the reliability of RED-neoantigens in predicting the prognosis in an independent cohort and found that patients with high RED-neoantigens exhibited a longer OS (P = 0.008). To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess the clinical relevance of RED-neoantigens in melanoma patients treated with immunotherapy.",2023,12,27
Silencing of KIF2C enhances the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to cisplatin through regulating the PI3K/AKT/MAPK signaling pathway.,"In the treatment of unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cisplatin is administered transhepatic arterially for local treatment, but the clinical application of cisplatin drugs is frequently hindered by the emergence of drug resistance. Kinesin family member 2C(KIF2C) has been shown as oncogene in a variety of tumors. Nevertheless, its effect on cisplatin sensitivity has yet to be ascertained. Herein, we aim to investigate the impact of the KIF2C gene on cisplatin sensitivity within HCC and the plausible underlying molecular mechanism. We examined the expression level of the KIF2C gene in HCC cells by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analysis, and analyzed bioinformatically by The Gene Expression Omnibus database and The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The KIF2C gene was silenced using the small interfering RNA technology, and its effect on cisplatin drug sensitivity in HCC cells was evaluated by flow cytometry, cell proliferation, cell migration, and invasion assays. Our results indicated that KIF2C was highly expressed in HCC cells. KIF2C silencing inhibits HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, promotes apoptosis, and keeps the cell cycle in G2 phase. In addition, KIF2C silencing enhanced the sensitivity of HCC cells to cisplatin. KIF2C silencing down-regulates the expression levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3) proteins. In conclusion, KIF2C silencing amplifies the sensitivity of HCC cells to cisplatin by regulating the PI3K/AKT/MAPK signaling pathway. Consequently, targeting KIF2C shows great application potential as a strategy for enhancing the effectiveness of HCC treatment.",2023,12,27
"""Five birds one stone"" tri-modal monitoring driven lab-on-magnetic aptasensor for accurate pathogen detection and enhanced germicidal application.","The effective combination of ultra-precise detection and on-demand sterilization stands out as one of the most valuable antifouling methods to combat pathogenic bacteria source and ensure the environment and food safety. Herein, an innovative ""five birds one stone"" aptasensor has been reported. It integrates magnetic separation, tri-modal precision detection, and efficient sterilization for monitoring of Staphylococcus aureus. Firstly, as a switch of the aptasensor, aptamer-modified potassium chloride-doped carbon dots (apt/KCl@CDs) could be adsorbed onto the surface of magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotube composites (M-MWCNTs) through π-π stacking, which could be replaced by the specific binding of the target bacteria to the aptamer. The mutual interference between the nanomaterials could be eliminated by this reverse magnetosorption strategy, enhancing the test sensitivity. In addition to the fluorescence properties, the peroxidase activity possessed by apt/KCl@CDs enables the conversion of the (3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine) TMB-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> colorimetric system to a photothermal modal. Then, the ultra-precision detection in the assay was achieved by the fluorescence-colorimetric-photothermal tri-modal sensing from the formation of S. aureus-apt/KCl@CDs in the supernatant. Besides, the efficient sterilization could be ensured by adsorbing the apt/KCl@CDs on the surface of S. aureus, generating toxic •OH for direct attacking cells. This was the first report that was more beneficial for bacterial eradication. The detection limits of fluorescence, colorimetric and photothermal modals were 4.81 cfu/mL, 3.40 cfu/mL and 6.74 cfu/mL, respectively. The magnetic nanoplatform integrating tri-modal detection-sterilization meets the demand for highly sensitive and precise detection in different scenarios, providing immediate control for pathogens and broad application prospects.",2023,12,28
Role of tumor budding and fibrotic cancer stroma in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an aggressive cancer with an increased frequency of lymph node metastasis at the time of presentation. Tumour budding, characterised by the presence of a single cell or a small grouping of tumour cells (a cluster containing fewer than five malignant cells) at the invasive front and composition of the fibrotic cancer stroma has been demonstrated to have a growing impact on the behaviour of the solid tumour. However exact role played by them is yet to be defined and a standardized scoring system needs to be incorporated.",2023,12,21
Tissue-specific RNA methylation prediction from gene expression data using sparse regression models.,"N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is a highly prevalent and conserved post-transcriptional modification observed in mRNA and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). Identifying potential m<sup>6</sup>A sites within RNA sequences is crucial for unraveling the potential influence of the epitranscriptome on biological processes. In this study, we introduce Exp2RM, a novel approach that formulates single-site-based tissue-specific elastic net models for predicting tissue-specific methylation levels utilizing gene expression data. The resulting ensemble model demonstrates robust predictive performance for tissue-specific methylation levels, with an average R-squared value of 0.496 and a median R-squared value of 0.482 across all 22 human tissues. Since methylation distribution varies among tissues, we trained the model to incorporate similar patterns, significantly improves accuracy with the median R-squared value increasing to 0.728. Additonally, functional analysis reveals Exp2RM's ability to capture coefficient genes in relevant biological processes. This study emphasizes the importance of tissue-specific methylation distribution in enhancing prediction accuracy and provides insights into the functional implications of methylation sites.",2023,12,26
Multi-biomarker combination detection system for diagnosis and classification of dry eye disease by imaging of a multi-channel metasurface.,"Dry eye disease (DED) is one of the most common ocular surface diseases, characterized by unstable tear film and ocular inflammation, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Currently, the clinical diagnosis of DED mainly relies on physical methods such as optical microscopy and ocular surface interferometric imaging, but classifying DED is still difficult. Here, we propose a compact and portable immune detection system based on the direct imaging of a nanophotonic metasurface with gradient geometry, for fast and ultra-sensitive detection of multiple biomarkers (i.e. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), Lipocalin-1 (LCN-1), Lactoferrin (LTF)) in tears for the diagnosis and classification of DED. This centimeter-scale concentric nanophotonic metasurface, which consists of millions of unique metallic nanostructures, was fabricated through a cost-effective nanoimprint lithography (NIL) process. The immune detection system based on the antibody-modified metasurface shows favorable detection selectivity, an ultra-high sensitivity (3350 pixels/Refractive Index Unit (RIU)) and low limit of detection (LOD) (0.3 ng/mL for MMP-9, 1 ng/mL for LTF, and 0.5 ng/mL for LCN-1). Further clinical sampling and detection results demonstrated that this multi-biomarker detection system enabled accurate determination and symptom classification of DED, manifesting high correlation and consistency with clinical diagnosis results. The advantages such as low sample consumption, one-step detection, simple operation, and simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers make the platform promising for screening and detecting a broader range of biomarker combinations in clinical practice.",2023,12,16
Emergence of nanoscale viscoelasticity from single cancer cells to established tumors.,"Tumors are complex materials whose physical properties dictate growth and treatment outcomes. Recent evidence suggests time-dependent physical properties, such as viscoelasticity, are crucial, distinct mechanical regulators of cancer progression and malignancy, yet the genesis and consequences of tumor viscoelasticity are poorly understood. Here, using Wide-bandwidth AFM-based ViscoElastic Spectroscopy (WAVES) coupled with mathematical modeling, we probe the origins of tumor viscoelasticity. From single carcinoma cells to increasingly sized carcinoma spheroids to established tumors, we describe a stepwise evolution of dynamic mechanical properties that create a nanorheological signature of established tumors: increased stiffness, decreased rate-dependent stiffening, and reduced energy dissipation. We dissect this evolution of viscoelasticity by scale, and show established tumors use fluid-solid interactions as the dominant mechanism of mechanical energy dissipation as opposed to fluid-independent intrinsic viscoelasticity. Additionally, we demonstrate the energy dissipation mechanism in spheroids and established tumors is negatively correlated with the cellular density, and this relationship strongly depends on an intact actin cytoskeleton. These findings define an emergent and targetable signature of the physical tumor microenvironment, with potential for deeper understanding of tumor pathophysiology and treatment strategies.",2023,12,22
The spatial transcriptomic landscape of human gingiva in health and periodontitis.,"The gingiva is a key oral barrier that protects oral tissues from various stimuli. A loss of gingival tissue homeostasis causes periodontitis, one of the most prevalent inflammatory diseases in humans. The human gingiva exists as a complex cell network comprising specialized structures. To understand the tissue-specific pathophysiology of the gingiva, we applied a recently developed spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq) technique to obtain a spatial transcriptome (ST) atlas of the gingiva in healthy individuals and periodontitis patients. By utilizing Stereo-seq, we identified the major cell types present in the gingiva, which included epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells, as well as subgroups of epithelial cells and immune cells. We further observed that inflammation-related signalling pathways, such as the JAK-STAT and NF-κB signalling pathways, were significantly upregulated in the endothelial cells of the gingiva of periodontitis patients compared with those of healthy individuals. Additionally, we characterized the spatial distribution of periodontitis risk genes in the gingiva and found that the expression of IFI16 was significantly increased in endothelial cells of inflamed gingiva. In conclusion, our Stereo-seq findings may facilitate the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for periodontitis by mapping periodontitis-relevant genes and pathways and effector cells.",2023,12,15
"[Research and progress on etiology, prevention and treatment strategies of secondary caries].","Secondary caries is one of the main reasons that affect the service life of the restoration. Compared with primary caries, secondary caries have some particularities in etiology, disease progression, clinical manifestation, clinical diagnosis, treatment and prevention.

Sodium nitrophenolate mediates brassinosteroids signaling to enhance cold tolerance of cucumber seedling.,"Cold stress (CS) significantly limits cucumber yield. However, it remains unclear whether and how sodium nitrophenolate (CSN) regulates plant responses to cold stress. Here, H<sub>2</sub>O, CSN, 24-epibrassinolide (EBR), and CSN + EBR were sprayed on cucumber seedlings before or after CS, and on control plants. We found that CSN, EBR, or EBR + CSN pre-treatment improved seedling growth under normal conditions (control condition) and cold tolerance under CS conditions. EBR pre-treatment promoted the expression of approximately half of the genes involved in BR synthesis and signaling and CsICE-CsCBF-CsCOR under CS. However, CSN pre-treatment promoted almost all the expression of BR synthesis and signaling genes, and CsICE-CsCBF-CsCOR genes, which showed the highest expression in early CS, remarkably improving the cold tolerance of cucumber. Interestingly, EBR and CSN had a superimposed effect on the expression of BR synthesis and signaling and CsICE-CsCBF-CsCOR genes, which rapidly increased their expression under normal temperature. Spraying EBR after CS accelerated seedling recovery, whereas CSN had the opposite effect. However, spraying CSN combined with EBR accelerated the recovery of CS-injured seedlings and was better than spraying EBR alone. Although CS-injured seedlings were negatively influenced by CSN, pre-treatment with CSN accelerated seedling growth and increased cold tolerance, suggesting that the effect of CSN was related to whether the seedlings were damaged by CS. In conclusion, we firstly found that CSN enhanced cold tolerance by activating BR signaling, contributing to the gene expression of ICE-CBF-COR and that CSN + EBR contributed to cold tolerance and CS-injured seedling recovery in cucumber.",2023,12,30
Transcriptome analysis reveals diverse Curvularia tsudae strategies in response to cadmium stress.,"Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic heavy metal that poses significant threats to living organisms. Curvularia tsudae has demonstrated remarkable survival capabilities in the presence of high Cd concentrations, exhibiting its exceptional Cd tolerance. Although some physiological studies have been conducted, the molecular mechanisms underlying Cd tolerance in C. tsudae is largely unknown. In this study, a comparative transcriptome analysis was performed to explore the molecular mechanisms of C. tsudae under Cd stress. Among the 10,498 identified unigenes, 2526 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the Cd-free and Cd-treated samples. Functional annotation and enrichment analysis of these DEGs identified several key biological processes involved in coping with Cd stress. Genes related to cell wall modification and organic acid metabolism contributes to Cd binding or chelation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis further highlighted the modifications in functional groups with the cell wall under Cd stress. Furthermore, the transporters tended to be modulated in response to Cd stress, and up-regulated genes involved in antioxidants likely contributes to high Cd tolerance. The processes from DNA to protein metabolism appeared to responsive to the presence of Cd stress as well. These results contribute to the advance of the current knowledge about the response of C. tsudae to Cd stress and lay the foundation for further advancements in using fungi for the remediation of Cd-polluted environments.",2023,12,31
Managing chronic pain after breast cancer treatments: are web-based interventions the future?,"Chronic post-treatment pain in breast cancer affects a high proportion of patients.

This review aims to explore the need for, range of, and effectiveness of such interventions.",2023,12,22
The Arabidopsis katamari2 Mutant Exhibits a Hypersensitive Seedling Arrest Response at the Phase Transition from Heterotrophic to Autotrophic Growth.,"Young seedlings use nutrients stored in the seeds to grow and acquire photosynthetic potential. This process, called seedling establishment, involves a developmental phase transition from heterotrophic to autotrophic growth. Some membrane-trafficking mutants of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), such as the katamari2 (kam2) mutant, exhibit growth arrest during seedling development, with a portion of individuals failing to develop true leaves on sucrose-free solid medium. However, the reason for this seedling arrest is unclear. In this study, we show that seedling arrest is a temporal growth arrest response that occurs not only in kam2 but also in wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis; however, the threshold for this response is lower in kam2 than in the WT. A subset of the arrested kam2 seedlings resumed growth after transfer to fresh sucrose-free medium. Growth arrest in kam2 on sucrose-free medium was restored by increasing the gel concentration of the medium or covering the surface of the medium with a perforated plastic sheet. WT Arabidopsis seedlings were also arrested when the gel concentration of sucrose-free medium was reduced. RNA sequencing revealed that transcriptomic changes associated with the rate of seedling establishment were observed as early as 4 d after sowing. Our results suggest that the growth arrest of both kam2 and WT seedlings is an adaptive stress response and is not simply caused by the lack of a carbon source in the medium. This study provides a new perspective on an environmental stress response under unfavorable conditions during the phase transition from heterotrophic to autotrophic growth in Arabidopsis.",2023,12,07
End-of-life care discussions with healthcare providers and dying experiences: A latent class analysis using the health and retirement study.,The impact of provider-patient end-of-life care conversations on the dying experience as a multi-dimensional concept among non-White population is understudied.

Frequency of laughter and work engagement among Japanese employees: a cross-sectional study during COVID-19.,"Laughter is associated with better health and occurs most frequently during casual conversations. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has impaired social interactions, which may have reduced the frequency of laughter and led to poor well-being among workers. This study investigated the relationship between laughter frequency and work engagement among Japanese employees during the pandemic. We conducted a web-based survey among Japanese employees (20-59 years) via an internet survey company in December 2021; 1,058 valid data were analysed. Of the respondents, 65.1% laughed at least once a week, but the frequency was much lower than that reported in previous studies conducted before the pandemic. Additionally, those who laughed at least once a week had significantly higher work engagement scores than those who laughed less than once a month. Although employees reduced their frequency of laughter during the pandemic, a certain frequency of laughter may be important for maintaining their work engagement.",2023,12,29
Coastal degradation regulates the availability and diffusion kinetics of phosphorus at the sediment-water interface: Mechanisms and environmental implications.,"Coastal wetlands have experienced considerable loss and degradation globally. However, how coastal degradation regulates sediment phosphorus (P) transformation and its underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown in subtropical coastal ecosystems. This study conducted seasonal field measurements using high-resolution diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT) and dialysis (Peeper) techniques, as well as a DGT-induced fluxes in sediments (DIFS) model, to evaluate the mobilization and diffusion of P along a degradation gradient ranging from pristine wetlands to moderately and severely degraded sites. We observed that sediment P is diminished by coastal degradation, and severely degraded sites exhibit a decline in the concentration of available P, despite the presence of distinct seasonal patterns. High-resolution data based on DGT/Peeper analysis revealed that labile P and soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations varied from 0.0006 mg L<sup>-1</sup> to 0.084 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (mean 0.0147 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) and from 0.0128 mg L<sup>-1</sup> to 0.1677 mg L<sup>-1</sup> (mean 0.0536 mg L<sup>-1</sup>), respectively. Coastal degradation had a substantial impact on increasing SRP and labile P concentrations, particularly at severely degraded sites. Although severely degraded wetlands appeared to be P sinks (negative P flux at these sites), we did also observe positive diffusive flux in October, indicating that coastal degradation may accelerate the diffusion and remobilization of sediment P into overlying water. The simulations of the DIFS model provided compelling proof of the high resupply capacity of sediment P at severely degraded sites, as supported by the increased R and k<sub>-1</sub> values but decreased T<sub>c</sub> values. Taken together, these results suggest coastal degradation reduces the sediment P pool, primarily attributed to the strong remobilization of P from the sediment to porewater and overlying water by enhancing the resupply capability and diffusion kinetics. This acceleration induces nutrient loss which adversely impacts the water quality of the surrounding ecosystem. To reduce the adverse effects of coastal degradation, it is essential to adopt a combination of conservation, restoration, and management efforts designed to mitigate the risk of internal P loading and release, and ultimately maintain a regional nutrient balance.",2023,12,28
Accuracy and stability of the condyle position after orthognathic surgery: A retrospective study.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and stability of condylar positioning in patients treated with bimaxillary procedures compared with patients treated with maxillary procedures alone. All patients had undergone treatment at Odense University Hospital and were treated with inferior maxillary procedures. The primary outcome was changes in condyle position and the primary predictor variable was time: pre-operative (T<sub>0</sub>) measurements to 1-week post-operative (T<sub>1</sub>) and 1-year post-operative (T<sub>2</sub>) measurements. Condyle movement was measured using dual voxel-based alignment. Sixteen patients were included. Seven patients underwent solitary maxillary procedure and 9 patients bimaxillary procedure. Bimaxillary procedures overall showed a condyle positional change in pitch from T<sub>0</sub> to T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>2</sub> compared to maxillary procedures alone. Condylar translation was stable despite large differences in positioning. Compared to solitary maxillary procedures, bimaxillary procedures showed a statistically significant anterocranial rotation at 1-week follow-up movement (3.95° vs. -0.95°; SD 3,74 vs 1,05; P value = 0.000) and an additional statistically significant anterocranial movement at 1 year after surgery (4.89° vs 0.60°; SD 3,82 vs 0,92; P value = 0.000). In conclusion a need for greater anterocranial stability of the sagittal split osteotomy than that provided by 3 bicortically fixated screws alone might be indicated.",2023,12,28
Data pyramid structure for optimizing EUS-based GISTs diagnosis in multi-center analysis with missing label.,"This study introduces the Data Pyramid Structure (DPS) to address data sparsity and missing labels in medical image analysis. The DPS optimizes multi-task learning and enables sustainable expansion of multi-center data analysis. Specifically, It facilitates attribute prediction and malignant tumor diagnosis tasks by implementing a segmentation and aggregation strategy on data with absent attribute labels. To leverage multi-center data, we propose the Unified Ensemble Learning Framework (UELF) and the Unified Federated Learning Framework (UFLF), which incorporate strategies for data transfer and incremental learning in scenarios with missing labels. The proposed method was evaluated on a challenging EUS patient dataset from five centers, achieving promising diagnostic performance. The average accuracy was 0.984 with an AUC of 0.927 for multi-center analysis, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches. The interpretability of the predictions further highlights the potential clinical relevance of our method.",2023,12,28
Quality Improvement Methodology to Improve Standardized Reporting of Pediatric Thyroid Ultrasounds Using TI-RADS.,The process of evaluating pediatric thyroid nodules at our institution was inconsistent with a high rate of negative biopsies raising concern of appropriate patient selection for biopsy.

An Overview of Recent Advances in Anterior Cervical Decompression and Fusion Surgery.,"Anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) has evolved significantly in the last few years with the aim of enhancing effectiveness and safety while reducing hospitalization and healthcare-related costs. Transitioning from iliac crest autografts to allografts minimizes donor-site complications like pain, infections, and hematoma. Allograft options, such as polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and tantalum, vary in their osteoinductive properties and elastic modulus, influencing fusion rates, time, and the rate of subsidence. Recently introduced zero-profile cages offer bone fixation through screws, resulting in reduced blood loss, improved spinal alignment, and decreased complications like dysphagia and adjacent segment disease. Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) has gained widespread use. The North American Spine Society (NASS) 2023 recommendations endorse IONM in cervical deformity corrections and myelopathy cases. Insufficient studies hinder clear radiculopathy recommendations, but emerging research supports IONM for patients at greater risk of C5 nerve root injury or positional injury. Advancements in hemostatic agents, such as gelatin sponges, oxidized cellulose, and fibrin sealants, contribute to safety by reducing postoperative hematoma rates and eliminating the need for drainage. Innovations like the exoscope, endoscope, and computed-tomography (CT) navigation have transformed surgical practices. Exoscopes are emerging as an alternative to microscopes, offering benefits like a smaller footprint, adjustable positioning, lower costs, and shared intraoperative views for educational purposes. The use of endoscope offers the possibility of performing a minimally invasive technique with improved results in terms of cosmesis and patient-perceived outcome. CT navigation can be useful in high-risk procedures, such as cervical plate placement for major instability. This paper provides an overview of cutting-edge technologies in ACDF surgery, emphasizing cage materials and designs, safety measures, and operating room advancements. It also highlights areas for future research, underlining the procedure's continuous evolution.",2023,12,29
"Effect of dietary Glycyrrhiza polysaccharides on growth performance, hepatic antioxidant capacity and anti-inflammatory capacity of broiler chickens.","The primary aim of this study was to investigate the impact of varying levels of dietary Glycyrrhiza polysaccharides (GPS) on the health status of broiler chickens. A total of 288 1-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly assigned to four groups with six replicates, consisting of 12 chickens in each replicate. The control group (CON) was provided with the basal diet, while the experimental groups were administered 300, 600, and 900 mg/kg of GPS in the basal diet for 42 days. The results demonstrated a significant enhancement in average daily gain (ADG) as a result of GPS supplementation (P < 0.05). The dietary GPS significantly elevated total antioxidation capability (T-AOC) and the activity of antioxidant enzymes (P < 0.05), while effectively reducing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the serum and liver (P < 0.05). Administration of GPS notably inhibited the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway (P < 0.05), decreased interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels (P < 0.05), and increased IL-4 and IL-10 levels (P < 0.05). Additionally, the expression of crucial regulators involved in liver lipid metabolism, including sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). In contrast, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) was significantly enhanced in the GPS-supplemented groups (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the supplementation of GPS positively influenced the growth performance, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity of the liver, as well as liver lipid metabolism in broilers.",2023,12,22

Existing knowledge gaps in PCT implementation are also discussed.",2023,12,22
Source-sink coordinated peanut cultivar increases yield and kernel protein content through enhancing photosynthetic characteristics and regulating carbon and nitrogen metabolisms.,"The grain yield of crops is determined by the synergistic interaction between source activity and sink capacity. However, source-sink interactions are far from being fully understood of peanut. Therefore, a 2-year field study (2018-2019) was conducted to compare differences in photosynthetic characteristics, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and yield and quality of different source-sink peanut varieties. Four representative source-sink types were examined: JH5 (source-sink coordination type), SH9 (sufficient source-large sink type), ZH24 (sufficient source-few sink type), and HY36 (large source-few sink type). The results showed that the photosynthetic potential of HY36 was higher than that of the other varieties after flowering because of a large source (leaves), whereas the chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate of HY36 were significantly lower than those of JH5 and ZH24. Proportions of dry matter transferred to pods were significantly different among four source-sink peanut varieties. From 50 days after flowering, the dry matter distribution ratio of pods exceeded that of stems and leaves in JH5, significantly earlier than other varieties, which prolong the duration of pod-filling period, followed by SH9 and ZH24. The activities of nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and glutamate synthase in JH5 were the highest among the varieties, and thus, the highest protein content was also in JH5. The activities of sucrose synthase and sucrose phosphate synthase in ZH24 were significantly higher than those in HY36. The highest oil content was also in ZH24. Among pod sink characteristics and yield, SH9 had the longest flowering period and the highest gynophore formation rate but the lowest pod-bearing rate, and the effective proportion and pod fullness were also lower than those of other varieties. The highest pod rate was in ZH24. The effective proportion and pod fullness of JH5 were higher than those of the other varieties, and its yield was also the highest, followed by SH9 and ZH24, with the lowest yield in HY36. The obtained results indicate that the source-sink coordinated variety had high P<sub>n</sub> and chlorophyll content in the late growth stage, a long functional period of leaves, and a high proportion of assimilates transported to pods, thus promoting effective proportions and pod fullness to improve peanut yield and protein content, suggesting that different cultivation and management measures should select for different peanut varieties to best coordinate the relationship between the source and sink.",2023,12,30
LncRNA-HOXC-AS2 regulates tumor-associated macrophage polarization through the STAT1/SOCS1 and STAT1/CIITA pathways to promote the progression of non-small cell lung cancer.,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) mainly exhibit the characteristics of M2-type macrophages, and the regulation of TAM polarization is a new target for cancer therapy, among which lncRNAs are key regulatory molecules. This study aimed to explore the effects of lncRNA-HOXC-AS2 on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by regulating TAM polarization. THP-1 cells were used to differentiate into macrophages, and TAMs were obtained by coculture with A549 cells. The M1/M2 cell phenotype and HOXC-AS2 expression were detected, and A549-derived exosomes (A549-exo) were used to elucidate the effects of A549 on macrophage polarization and HOXC-AS2 expression. Then, by interfering with HOXC-AS2 or STAT1, the effects of HOXC-AS2 regulation of STAT1 on the TAM phenotype and STAT1/SOCS1 and STAT1/CIITA pathways were analyzed, and the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells in the coculture system were also detected. Results showed that HOXC-AS2 expression in M2 macrophages and TAMs was significantly higher than that in M1 macrophages, and A549-exo promoted HOXC-AS2 expression and M2 polarization. Intervention HOXC-AS2 resulted in increased M1 marker expression, decreased M2 marker expression, and activation of STAT1/SOCS1 and STAT1/CIITA pathways in TAMs. In addition, HOXC-AS2 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of TAMs and could bind to STAT1. Further experiments confirmed that intervention HOXC-AS2 promoted the M1 polarization of TAMs by targeting STAT1 and weakened the promoting effects of TAMs on the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC. In conclusion, HOXC-AS2 inhibited the activation of STAT1/SOCS1 and STAT1/CIITA pathways and promoted M2 polarization of TAMs by binding with STAT1, thus promoting NSCLC.",2023,12,31
Cardiovascular Risk Age Reflects Arterial Status: Middle-Aged People Showed Equivalent Arterial Stiffness to Older People in the Same Risk Category.,"The concept of risk age may help overcome an excessive weight of age in cardiovascular risk functions.

In order to materialize this aim, we categorized individuals based on cardiovascular risk and compared groups with increased risk factors (other than age) and groups with normal levels.",2023,12,28
"Integrated ""-omics"" analysis highlights the role of brassinosteroid signaling and antioxidant machinery underlying improved rice seed longevity during artificial aging treatment.","Seed longevity is a critical characteristic in agriculture, yet the specific genes/proteins responsible for this trait and the molecular mechanisms underlying reduced longevity during seed aging remain largely elusive. Here we report the comparative proteome and metabolome profiling of three rice cultivars exhibiting varying degrees of aging tolerance: Dharial, an aging-tolerant cultivar; Ilmi, an aging-sensitive cultivar; and A2, a moderately aging-tolerant cultivar developed from the crossbreeding of Dharial and Ilmi. Artificial aging treatment (AAT) markedly reduced the germination percentage and enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes in all the cultivars. Further, proteomics results showed a key role of the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome pathway in the degradation of damaged proteins during AAT while other proteases were majorly reduced. In addition, proteins associated with energy production and protein synthesis were strongly reduced in Ilmi while these were majorly increased in A2 and Dharial. These, along with metabolomics results, suggest that Ub-proteasome mediated protein degradation during AAT results in the accumulation of free amino acids in Ilmi while tolerant cultivars potentially utilize those for energy production and synthesis of stress-related proteins, especially hsp20/alpha-crystallin family protein. Additionally, both Dharial and A2 seem to activate brassinosteroid signaling and suppress jasmonate signaling which initiates a signaling cascade that allows accumulation of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants for efficient detoxification of aging-induced ROS. Taken together, these results provide an in-depth understanding of the aging-induced changes in rice seeds and highlight key pathways responsible for maintaining seed longevity during AAT.",2023,12,23
"Design, synthesis and antitumor activity of 4-arylamine substituted pyrimidine derivatives as noncovalent EGFR inhibitors overcoming C797S mutation.","Clinical researches have shown that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key target for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Many EGFR inhibitors were successfully developed as ani-tumor drugs to treat NSCLC patients. Unfortunately, drug resistances were found in clinic. To overcome C797S mutation in EGFR, a novel series of 4-arylamine substituted pyrimidine derivatives were designed and synthesized under the principle of structure-based drug design. Interestingly, compounds 6e and 9i demonstrated the best anti-proliferative activity against A549, NCI-H1975, and HCC827 cells. In particular, the IC<sub>50</sub> values against HCC827 cells reached to 24.6 nM and 31.6 nM, which were much lower than human normal cells 2BS and LO2. Furthermore, compounds 6e and 9i showed extraordinary activity against EGFR<sup>19del/T790M/C797S</sup> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 16.06 nM and 37.95 nM) and EGFR<sup>L858R/T790M/C797S</sup> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 11.81 nM and 26.68 nM), which were potent than Osimertinib (IC<sub>50</sub> = 52.28 nM and 157.60 nM). Further studies have shown that compounds 6e and 9i could pertain inhibition of HCC827 colony formation, and arrest HCC827 cells at G2/M phase. Moreover, the most promising compound 6e could inhibit the migration of HCC827 cells, induce HCC827 cells apoptosis, and significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and Erk<sub>1/2</sub>. In vivo xenograft mouse model with HCC827 cells, compound 6e resulted in remarkable tumor regression without obvious toxicity. In addition, molecular docking studies suggested that compound 6e could firmly combine with T790M-mutant, T790 M/C797S-mutant, and L858R/T790 M/C797S-mutant EGFR kinases as ATP-competitive inhibitor.",2023,12,29

Enhanced adaptation to salinity stress in lentil seedlings through the use of trehalose-functionalized silica nanoparticles (TSiNPs): Exploring silica-sugar absorption and oxidative balance.,"Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) confer better growth and development of plants under salinity stress. Moreover, the surface-functionalization of SiNPs with bioactive molecules is expected to enhance its efficacy. The present study thus aimed to modify the surface of SiNPs, by attaching a bioactive molecule (trehalose) to obtain TSiNPs. The successful surface functionalization was confirmed using FTIR, XRD, and EDS. The spherical shape and amorphous nature of the nanoparticles were confirmed using SEM. The TEM image analysis revealed that the size of SiNPs and TSiNPs ranged between 20-50 nm and 200-250 nm, respectively. A novel bioassay experiment designed to study the release of silica and trehalose from nanoparticles elucidated that the TSiNPs improved the release and uptake of silica. Also, trehalose uptake significantly improved after 72 h of application due to enhanced release of trehalose from TSiNPs. Further, this study also aimed to investigate the potential benefits of SiNPs and TSiNPs in promoting the growth and development of plants under salinity stress. In this context, the nanoparticles were applied to the saline-stressed (0, 200, 300 mM) lentil seedlings for the in-planta experiments. The results revealed that both SiNPs and TSiNPs improved the growth of seedlings (shoot, and root length), ionic balance (K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio), and osmolyte status (sugars, proline, glycine betaine, trehalose). Additionally, increased antioxidant enzyme activities helped scavenge ROS (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub><sup>.-</sup>) generated in NaCl-stressed seedlings, ultimately improving the membrane integrity (by reducing MDA and EL). However, the TSiNPs exhibited a much-enhanced activity in stress alleviation compared to the SiNPs.",2023,12,28
Validation of Estimated Small Dense Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Concentration in a Japanese General Population.,"A high level of directly measured small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sdLDL-C) is a strong risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

We investigated the validation and exploration of estimated sdLDL-C level.",2023,12,29
Effect of membrane tension on antimicrobial peptide PGLa-induced pore formation in lipid bilayers.,"The osmotic pressure (Π) method has recently been developed to quantitatively examine the effect of membrane tension (σ) on pore formation in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) induced by antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Here, we used the Π method to reveal the effect of σ on the interaction of an AMP, PGLa, with lipid bilayers comprising dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) (4/6). PGLa induced leakage of fluorescent probes from single GUVs under Π, indicating nanopore formation. Membrane tension did not transform a PGLa-induced nanopore into a micropore nor cause GUV burst up to 3.4 mN/m, which is in contrast with the effect of σ on another AMP, magainin 2-induced pore formation, where lower σ resulted in GUV burst. The fraction of leaking GUVs at a specific time increased with increasing σ, indicating that the rate of PGLa-induced pore formation increases with increasing σ. The rate of transfer of fluorescent probe-labeled PGLa across the lipid bilayer without pore formation also increased with increasing σ. PGLa-induced pore formation requires a symmetric distribution of peptides in both leaflets of the GUV bilayer, and thus we infer that the increase in the rate of PGLa transfer from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet underlies the increase in the rate of pore formation with increasing σ. On the basis of these results, we discuss the difference between the effect of σ on nanopore formation in GUV membranes induced by PGLa and that by magainin 2.",2023,12,28

A hybrid deep learning approach to improve real-time effluent quality prediction in wastewater treatment plant.,"Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operation is usually intricate due to large variations in influent characteristics and nonlinear sewage treatment processes. Effective modeling of WWTP effluent water quality can provide valuable decision-making support to facilitate their operations and management. In this study, we developed a novel hybrid deep learning model by combining the temporal convolutional network (TCN) model with the long short-term memory (LSTM) network model to improve the simulation of hourly total nitrogen (TN) concentration in WWTP effluent. The developed model was tested in a WWTP in Jiangsu Province, China, where the prediction results of the hybrid TCN-LSTM model were compared with those of single deep learning models (TCN and LSTM) and traditional machine learning model (feedforward neural network, FFNN). The hybrid TCN-LSTM model could achieve 33.1 % higher accuracy as compared to the single TCN or LSTM model, and its performance could improve by 63.6 % comparing to the traditional FFNN model. The developed hybrid model also exhibited a higher power prediction of WWTP effluent TN for the next multiple time steps within eight hours, as compared to the standalone TCN, LSTM, and FFNN models. Finally, employing model interpretation approach of Shapley additive explanation to identify the key parameters influencing the behavior of WWTP effluent water quality, it was found that removing variables that did not contribute to the model output could further improve modeling efficiency while optimizing monitoring and management strategies.",2023,12,30

Discovery of benzopyridone cyanoacetates as new type of potential broad-spectrum antibacterial candidates.,"Unique benzopyridone cyanoacetates (BCs) as new type of promising broad-spectrum antibacterial candidates were discovered with large potential to combat the lethal multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Many prepared BCs showed broad antibacterial spectrum with low MIC values against the tested strains. Some highly active BCs exhibited rapid sterilization capacity, low resistant trend and good predictive pharmacokinetic properties. Furthermore, the highly active sodium BCs (NaBCs) displayed low hemolysis and cytotoxicity, and especially octyl NaBC 5g also showed in vivo potent anti-infective potential and appreciable pharmacokinetic profiles. A series of preliminary mechanistic explorations indicated that these active BCs could effectively eliminate bacterial biofilm and destroy membrane integrity, thus resulting in the leakage of bacterial cytoplasm. Moreover, their unique structures might further bind to intracellular DNA, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV through various direct noncovalent interactions to hinder bacterial reproduction. Meanwhile, the active BCs also induced bacterial oxidative stress and metabolic disturbance, thereby accelerating bacterial apoptosis. These results provided a bright hope for benzopyridone cyanoacetates as potential novel multitargeting broad-spectrum antibacterial candidates to conquer drug resistance.",2023,12,30
Annexin-A1 short peptide alleviates septic myocardial injury by upregulating SIRT3 and inhibiting myocardial cell apoptosis.,"Septic myocardial injury is a common complication of severe sepsis, which occurs in about 50% of cases. Patients with this disease may experience varying degrees of myocardial damage. Annexin-A1 short peptide (ANXA1sp), with a molecular structure of Ac-Gln-Ala-Tyr, has been reported to exert an organ protective effect in the perioperative period by modulating sirtuin-3 (SIRT3). Whether it possesses protective activity against sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy is worthy of study. This study aimed to investigate whether ANXA1sp exerts its anti-apoptotic effect in septic myocardial injury in vitro and in vivo via regulating SIRT3. In this study, we established in vivo and in vivo models of septic myocardial injury based on C57BL/6 mice and primary cardiomyocytes by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction. Results showed that ANXA1sp pretreatment enhanced the seven-day survival rate, improved left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), left ventricular fractional shortening (FS), and cardiac output (CO), and reduced the levels of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Western blotting results revealed that ANXA1sp significantly increased the expression of SIRT3, Bcl-2, and downregulated Bax expression. TUNEL staining and flow cytometry results showed that ANXA1sp could attenuate the apoptosis rate of cardiomyocytes, whereas this anti-apoptotic effect was significantly attenuated after SIRT3 knockout. To sum up, ANXA1sp can alleviate LPS-induced myocardial injury by reducing myocardial apoptosis via SIRT3 upregulation.",2023,12,15
Semimetal 1T' phase molybdenum sulfide decorated on zinc indium sulfide with S-scheme heterojunction for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.,"Heterojunction engineering is an effective strategy to improve photocatalytic performance. Two-dimensional (2D)/2D semimetal 1T' phase molybdenum sulfide/zinc indium sulfide (1T'-MoS<sub>2</sub>/ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>) S-scheme heterojunctions with tight and stable interfaces were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal synthesis method. Under the optimal 1T'-MoS<sub>2</sub> loading ratio (5 wt%), the hydrogen production rate of 1T'-MoS<sub>2</sub>/ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> composites reaches 11.42 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, which is 3.1 and 1.4 times higher than that of pure ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> (2.9 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) and ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>/Pt (8.01 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), and the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) reaches 53.17 % (λ = 370 nm). Semimetal 1T' phase MoS<sub>2</sub> on ZnIn<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> broadens the light absorption range, enhances the light absorption ability, promotes electron transfer, and offers abundant active sites. The establishment of S-scheme heterojunctions achieves the spatial separation of photogenerated charges and increases the reduction potential.

Natural products fragment-based design and synthesis of a novel pentacyclic ring system as potential MAPK inhibitor.,"The synthesis of compounds based on fragments derived from natural products (NPs) serves as a source of inspiration for the design of pseudo-natural products (PNPs), to identify bioactive molecules that exhibit similar characteristics to NPs. These novel molecular scaffolds exhibit previously unexplored biological activities as well. This study reports the development and synthesis of a novel pentacyclic ring system, the indole-pyrimidine-quinoline (IPQ) scaffold. The design of this scaffold was based on the structural characteristics of four natural products, namely tryptanthrin, luotonin A, rutaecarpine, and camptothecin. Several successive steps accomplished the effective synthesis of the IPQ scaffold. The constituent components of the pentacycle, containing the indole, quinazolinone, pyrimidone, and quinoline units, possess significant biological significance. Compound 1a demonstrated noteworthy anti-tumor activity efficacy against A549 cell lines among the tested compounds. The compound 1a was observed to elicit cell cycle arrest in both the G2/M and S phases, as well as trigger apoptosis in A549 cells. These effects were attributed to its ability to modulate the activation of mitochondrial-related mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.",2023,12,31
A Multi-Institutional Description of Processes and Outcomes of Postbaccalaureate Research Education Programs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.,"Outcome data from 6 National Institutes of Health-funded Postbaccalaureate Research Education Programs (PREPs) in the Mid-Atlantic region were combined to give a multi-institutional perspective on their scholars' characteristics and progress through biomedical research training.

An antibacterial and anti-oxidant hydrogel containing hyperbranched poly-l-lysine and tea polyphenols accelerates healing of infected wound.,"Both bacteria-infection and excessive inflammation delay the wound healing process and even create non-healing wound, thus it is highly desirable to endow the wound dressing with bactericidal and anti-oxidation properties. Herein an antibacterial and antioxidation hydrogel based on Carbomer 940 (CBM) and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) loaded with tea polyphenols (TP) and hyperbranched poly-l-lysine (HBPL) was designed and fabricated. The hydrogel killed 99.9 % of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) at 10<sup>7</sup> CFU mL<sup>-1</sup>, and showed strong antioxidation against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and 2,2-di(4-tert-octylphenyl)-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radicals without noticeable cytotoxicity in vitro. The CBM/HPMC/HBPL/TP hydrogel significantly shortened the inflammatory period of the MRSA-infected full-thickness skin wound of rats in vivo, with 2 orders of lower MRSA colonies compared with the blank control, and promoted the wound closure especially at the earlier stage. The inflammation was suppressed and the vascularization was promoted significantly as well, resulting in reduced pro-inflammatory factors including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and increased anti-inflammatory factors such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-10 (IL-10).",2023,12,28

[Role and related mechanisms of liasr two-component system in acid tolerance and biofilm formation of <i>Streptococcus mutans</i>].,"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the role and related mechanisms of the LiaSR two-component system in acid tolerance and biofilm formation abilities of <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> (Sm) 593. <b>Methods:</b> The growth curves of various Sm strains in pH=5.5 brian heart infusion (BHI) medium were analyzed. And colony forming unit (CFU) was also performed to evaluate the acid tolerance of Sm. Laurdan probe, H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>adenosine triphosphate (ATP)ase activity analysis kit, proton permeability assay and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were conducted to detect the acid tolerant mechanisms of LiaSR two-component system in Sm. Crystal violet staining, CFU, SYTOX probe and anthrone-sulfuric method were used to analyze the properties and structures of the Sm biofilms. RT-qPCR was conducted to detect the expression levels of underlying regulated genes. <b>Results:</b> The growth of mutants in acidic BHI were inhibited (<i>P<</i>0.05). The acid tolerance of mutants significantly decreased compared to the wild-type strain (<i>P<</i>0.05). In mutants, the activity of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (917.06±59.53 and 469.53±47.65) were elevated by 7.22-folds and 3.70-folds compared to the wild-type strain (127.00±50.71) (<i>P<</i>0.001, <i>P<</i>0.001) and the encoded gene atpD (3.39±0.21 and 1.94±0.17) were also elevated by 3.39-folds and 1.94-folds compared to the wild-type strain (1.00±0.15) (<i>P<</i>0.001, <i>P=</i>0.001). The fluidity of mutants (0.18±0.04 and 0.18±0.05) reduced significantly compared to the wild-type strain (0.08±0.05) (<i>P=</i>0.006, <i>P=</i>0.003) and the expression levels of fabM gene were decreased in mutants (0.52±0.11 and 0.57±0.05) by 1/2 (<i>P=</i>0.014, <i>P=</i>0.022). In liaR deletion mutant, the increased proton permeability (4.76±0.01) can also be observed (<i>P<</i>0.001). The total amount of the biofilms of three Sm didn't show significant differences (<i>P></i>0.05). But the number of viable bacteria of mutants' biofilms were decreased [Sm 593: (1.20±2.80)×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml; Sm ΔliaS: (2.95±1.13)×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml; Sm ΔliaR: (7.25±1.60)×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml] (<i>P=</i>0.001, <i>P=</i>0.024). 18.00-folds and 6.50-folds increases of eDNA could be observed in mutants' biofilms (128.73±15.65 and 46.38±5.52) compared to the wild-type strain (7.16±3.62) (<i>P<</i>0.001, <i>P=</i>0.003). Water-soluble exopolysaccharides could be found up-regulated in liaS deletion mutant (138.73±10.12) (<i>P=</i>0.003) along with the expression level of gtfC gene (1.65±0.39) (<i>P=</i>0.014).

The LiaR can also decrease the proton permeability and restrict the entrance of H<sup>+</sup>. The LiaSR two-component system can negatively regulate the production of the extracellular matrix in Sm biofilm.",2023,12,29
Malonic acid shapes bacterial community dynamics in compost to promote carbon sequestration and humic substance synthesis.,"The incorporation of malonic acid (MA) into compost as a regulator of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle has the potential to increase carbon sequestration. However, the influence of MA on the transformation of the microbial community during the composting process remains unclear. In this investigation, MA was introduced at different stages of chicken manure (CM) composting to characterize the bacterial community within the compost using high-throughput sequencing. We assess the extent of increased carbon sequestration by comparing the concentration of total organic carbon (TOC). At the same time, this study examines whether increased carbon sequestration contributes to humus formation, which was elucidated by evaluating the content and composition of humus. Our results show that the addition of MA significantly improved carbon sequestration within the compost, reducing the carbon loss rate (C loss (%)) from 64.70% to 52.94%, while increasing HS content and stability. High throughput sequencing and Random Forest (RF) analysis show that the introduction of MA leads to a reduction in the diversity of the bacterial communities, but enhanced the ability of bacterial communities to synthesize humus. Furthermore, the addition of MA favors the proliferation of Firmicutes. Also, the hub of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within the community co-occurrence network shifts from Proteobacteria to Firmicutes. Remarkably, our study finds a significant decrease in negative correlations between bacteria, potentially mitigating substrate consumption due to negative interactions such as competition. This phenomenon contributes to the improved retention of TOC in the compost. This research provides new insights into the mechanisms by which MA regulates bacterial communities in compost, and provides a valuable theoretical basis for the adoption of this innovative composting strategy.",2023,12,31
Unveiling differential expression profiles of the wheat DOG1 gene family and functional analysis of the association between TaDOG1-1 and heat stress tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis.,"High temperatures can significantly impact wheat growth and grain yields during the grain-filling stage. In this study, we identified genes that respond to high-temperature stress during the grain-filling stage. We also identified and characterized 24 novel genes of the DOG1 gene family in hexaploid wheat. Motif analysis and conserved domain search revealed substantial similarities among TaDOG1 family members. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the evolutionary conservation of the TaDOG1 family across various plant species. Tissue-specific expression profiling indicated consistent patterns, with TaDOG1 genes predominantly expressed in stem tissues. Only TaDOG1-1 exhibited enhanced expression, particularly during hard dough and ripening stages. TaDOG1-1 and TaDOG1-7 exhibited increased expression under heat stress during the grain-filling stage, indicating their heat-responsive nature. Cis-element analysis revealed potential regulatory motifs, suggesting the involvement of TaDOG1-1 and TaDOG1-7 in stress tolerance mechanisms. Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed interacting proteins, including stress-responsive and grain development-associated proteins. To understand the biological function, we overexpressed TaDOG1-1 in Arabidopsis plants and observed enhanced thermotolerance under basal heat stress. Under heat stress, the transgenic plants exhibited increased biomass and elevated expression levels of heat-responsive genes. Furthermore, TaDOG1-1-overexpressing plants showed improved survival rates under soil heat stress, along with a greater accumulation of antioxidant enzymes in leaves. In this study, the identification and functions of the DOG1 gene family provide valuable insights for developing genetic engineering strategies aimed at improving wheat yield under high-temperature stress.",2023,12,29

In our previous report, we identified 1-{2,7-diazaspiro[3.5]non-2-yl}prop-2-en-1-one derivative (1) as a KRAS G12C inhibitor that covalently binds to Cys12 of KRAS G12C protein. Compound 1 exhibited potent cellular pERK inhibition and cell growth inhibition against a KRAS G12C mutation-positive cell line and showed an antitumor effect on subcutaneous administration in an NCI-H1373 (KRAS G12C mutation-positive cell line) xenograft mouse model in a dose-dependent manner. In this report, we further optimized the substituents on the quinazoline scaffold based on the structure-based drug design from the co-crystal structure analysis of compound 1 and KRAS G12C to enhance in vitro activity. As a result, ASP6918 was found to exhibit extremely potent in vitro activity and induce dose-dependent tumor regression in an NCI-H1373 xenograft mouse model after oral administration.",2023,12,27
Optimal preview pinning control of Boolean networks.,"This paper investigates the problem of optimal preview pinning control for Boolean networks. The primary objective is to design efficient control strategies that leverage future reference information for improved control performance. We propose a policy iteration algorithm specifically for Boolean networks based on an augmented error system, constructed using the state augmentation technique in combination with the Exclusive-Or operator approach. The algorithm effectively optimizes control policies using future information. Finally, an example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",2023,12,27

A New Hinge Prosthesis Offers Ease of Use and the Ability to Retain the Revision Tibial Baseplate.,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a widely practiced surgical procedure, with its efficacy underscored by the increasing number of patients benefiting from it. As primary TKAs rise, the orthopaedic community must prepare for a surge in complex primary and revision knee arthroplasties in the future. While most revisions use non-constrained or semi-constrained prostheses, certain scenarios require a fully constrained (hinge) prosthesis to address major ligamentous and/or bone loss. Over time, hinge designs have evolved, but outcomes with these designs have been mixed. To help address challenges seen with some earlier designs, a new modular revision solution has been designed for both primary and revision surgeries. This system has a new revision baseplate that has compatibilities with varying distal femoral components and introduces an enhanced hinge mechanism. This paper aims to explore the evolution of hinge designs, elaborate on the surgical workflows and intended compatibilities of this new revision hinge system in six different scenarios, and discuss its various potential advantages.",2023,12,29
A green pathway for lignin valorization: Enzymatic lignin depolymerization in biocompatible ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents.,"Lignin depolymerization, which enables the breakdown of a complex and heterogeneous aromatic polymer into relatively uniform derivatives, serves as a critical process in valorization of lignin. Enzymatic lignin depolymerization has become a promising biological strategy to overcome the heterogeneity of lignin, due to its mild reaction conditions and high specificity. However, the low solubility of lignin compounds in aqueous environments prevents efficient lignin depolymerization by lignin-degrading enzymes. The employment of biocompatible ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) in lignin fractionation has created a promising pathway to enzymatically depolymerize lignin within these green solvents to increase lignin solubility. In this review, recent research progress on enzymatic lignin depolymerization, particularly in a consolidated process involving ILs/DESs is summarized. In addition, the interactions between lignin-degrading enzymes and solvent systems are explored, and potential protein engineering methodology to improve the performance of lignin-degrading enzymes is discussed. Consolidation of enzymatic lignin depolymerization and biocompatible ILs/DESs paves a sustainable, efficient, and synergistic way to convert lignin into value-added products.",2023,12,26
Is fragment-based graph a better graph-based molecular representation for drug design? A comparison study of graph-based models.,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant traction in various sectors of AI-driven drug design. Over recent years, the integration of fragmentation concepts into GNNs has emerged as a potent strategy to augment the efficacy of molecular generative models. Nonetheless, challenges such as symmetry breaking and potential misrepresentation of intricate cycles and undefined functional groups raise questions about the superiority of fragment-based graph representation over traditional methods. In our research, we undertook a rigorous evaluation, contrasting the predictive prowess of eight models-developed using deep learning algorithms-across 12 benchmark datasets that span a range of properties. These models encompass established methods like GCN, AttentiveFP, and D-MPNN, as well as innovative fragment-based representation techniques. Our results indicate that fragment-based methodologies, notably PharmHGT, significantly improve model performance and interpretability, particularly in scenarios characterized by limited data availability. However, in situations with extensive training, fragment-based molecular graph representations may not necessarily eclipse traditional methods. In summation, we posit that the integration of fragmentation, as an avant-garde technique in drug design, harbors considerable promise for the future of AI-enhanced drug design.",2023,12,20
Flexible nanoplasmonic sensor for multiplexed and rapid quantitative food safety analysis with a thousand-times sensitivity improvement.,"The accumulation of trace amounts of certain small molecules in food poses considerable human health challenges, including the potential for carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. Here, an ultrasensitive gold-platinum nanoflower-coupled metasurface plasmon resonance (MetaSPR) (APNMSPR) biosensor, based on a competitive immunoassay, was developed for the multiplexed and rapid quantitative analysis of trace small molecules in eggs, offering timely monitoring of food safety. This one-step biosensor can be integrated into either a newly designed detachable high-throughput MetaSPR chip-strip plate device or a standard 96-well plate for multiplexed small-molecule detection within a single egg. The limits of detection were 0.81, 1.12, and 1.74 ppt for florfenicol, fipronil, and enrofloxacin, respectively, demonstrating up to 1000-fold increased sensitivity and a 15-fold reduction in analysis time compared with those of traditional methods. The results obtained using the APNMSPR biosensor showed a strong correlation with those obtained using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The APNMSPR biosensor holds immense promise for the multiplexed, highly sensitive, and rapid quantitative analysis of small molecules for applications in food safety control, early diagnosis, and environmental monitoring.",2023,12,28
[Frontiers and advances in dental caries research].,"Dental caries is a prevalent infectious disease caused by microbial metabolism, affecting the hard tissues of teeth. According to data from the Fourth National Oral Health Epidemiological Survey, there is a gradual increase in caries prevalence in China, particularly among children and elderly individuals. As an etiological factor for dental lesions, caries not only impact oral health but also exhibit significant associations with various systemic diseases, suggesting that systemic diseases may serve as potential risk factors of caries development. To effectively implement the plan of national oral health action, researchers investigate the pathogenesis of caries actively while concurrently develop innovative preventive and treatment strategies based on advanced concepts and technologies, aiming to comprehensively enhance China's oral health status. Therefore, this article provides insights into the pathogenesis of caries, its correlation with systemic diseases, as well as cutting-edge research advancements pertaining to novel preventive measures for caries.",2023,12,29
"Novel mitochondrial and DNA damaging fluorescent Calix[4]arenes bearing isatin groups as aromatase inhibitors: Design, synthesis and anticancer activity.","Breast cancer causes a high rate of mortality all over the world. Therefore, the present study focuses on the anticancer activity of new lower rim-functionalized calix[4]arenes integrated with isatin and the p-position of calixarenes with 1,4-dimethylpyridinium iodine against various human cancer cells such as MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, as well as the PNT1A healthy epithelial cell line. It was observed that compound 6c had the lowest values in MCF-7 (8.83 µM) and MDA-MB-231 (3.32 µM). Cell imaging and apoptotic activity studies were performed using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. The confocal imaging studies with 6c showed that the compound easily entered the cell, and it was observed that 6c accumulated in the mitochondria. The Comet assay test was used to detect DNA damage of compounds in cells. It was found that treated cells had abnormal tail nuclei and damaged DNA structures compared with untreated cells. In vitro human aromatase enzyme inhibition profiles showed that compound 6c had a remarkable inhibitory effect on aromatase. Compound 6c displayed a significant inhibition capacity on aromatase enzyme with the IC50 value of 0.104 ± 0.004 µM. Thus, not only the anticancer activity of the new fluorescent derivatives, which are the subject of this study, but the aromatase inhibitory profiles have also been proven.",2023,12,30
Elucidation of prognostic factors in the acute phase of feline severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus infection.,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a potentially fatal tick-borne zoonotic disease, endemic to Asian regions, including western Japan. Cats appear to suffer a particularly severe form of the disease; however, feline SFTS is not clinically well characterized. Accordingly, in this study, we investigated the associations of, demographic, hematological and biochemical, immunological, and virological parameters with clinical outcome (fatal cases vs. survivors) in SFTSV-positive cats. Viral genomic analysis was also performed. Viral load in blood, total bilirubin, creatine phosphokinase, serum amyloid A, interleukin-6, tumor necrotic factor-α, and virus-specific IgM and IgG differed significantly between survivors and fatal cases, and thus may have utility as prognosticators. Furthermore, survivor profiling revealed high-level of viremia with multiple parameters (white blood cells, platelet, total bilirubin, glucose, and serum amyloid A) beyond the reference range in the 7-day acute phase, and signs of clinical recovery in the post-acute phase (parameters returning to, or tending toward, the reference range). However, SFTSV was still detectable from some survived cats even 14 days after onset of disease, indicating the risk of infection posed by close-contact exposure may persist through the post-acute phase. This study provides useful information for prognostic assessments of acute feline SFTS, and may contribute to early treatment plans for cats with SFTS. Our findings also alert pet owners and animal health professionals to the need for prolonged vigilance against animal-to-human transmission when handling cats that have been diagnosed with SFTS.",2023,12,29
Magnetic particle image scanner based on asymmetric core-filled electromagnetic actuator.,"Monitoring the distribution of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in the vascular system is an important task for the advancement of precision therapeutics and drug delivery. Despite active targeting using active motilities, it is required to visualize the position and concentration of carriers that reach the target, to promote the development of this technology. In this work, a feasibility study is presented on a tomographic scanner that allows monitoring of the injected carriers quantitatively in a relatively short interval. The device is based on a small-animal-scale asymmetric magnetic platform integrated with magnetic particle imaging technology. An optimized isotropic field-free region (FFR) generation method using a magnetic manipulation system (MMS) is derived and numerically investigated. The in-vitro and in-vivo tracking performances are demonstrated with a high position accuracy of approximately 1 mm. A newly proposed tracking method was developed, specialized in vascular system, with quick scanning time (about 1s). In this paper, the primary function of the proposed system is to track magnetic particles using a magnetic manipulation system. Through this, proposed method enables the conventional magnetic actuation systems to upgrade the functionalities of both manipulation and localization of magnetic objects.",2023,12,20
Youth cannabis use and subsequent health service use for mood and anxiety disorders: A population-based cohort study.,"Epidemiologic research suggests a modest association between youth cannabis use and mood and anxiety disorders (MADs). However, current evidence is based mostly on cohort studies using data from the 20th century when cannabis was significantly less potent than today. We linked population-based survey data from 2009 to 2012 with administrative records of health services covered under universal healthcare up to 2017. The cohort included youth aged 12 to 24 years at baseline living in Ontario, Canada with no prior MAD health service use (n = 8,252). We conducted a multivariable Cox model to estimate the association between cannabis use frequency (never, <weekly, weekly+) and MAD health service use (hospitalization, ED visit, or outpatient physician visit) in the following 3 years, adjusting for sociodemographic factors and other substance use. Compared to no cannabis use, <weekly use was significantly associated with subsequent MAD health service use (aHR=1.48; 95 % CI: 1.10-1.99) while weekly+ use was not (aHR=0.92; 95 % CI: 0.63-1.34). Sex and age interactions were not significant on the multiplicative or additive scales. This study found a modest longitudinal association between youth cannabis use and MAD health service use but no evidence of a linear dose-response relationship. Further research is needed to clarify these findings.",2023,12,25
"Three-dimensional, dual-color nanoscopy enabled by migrating photon avalanches with one single low-power CW beam.","The development of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is very essential for understanding the physical and biological fundamentals at nanometer scale. However, to date most super-resolution modalities require either complicated/costly purpose-built systems such as multiple-beam architectures or complex post-processing procedures with intrinsic artifacts. Achieving three-dimensional (3D) or multi-channel sub-diffraction microscopic imaging using a simple method remains a challenging and struggling task. Herein, we proposed 3D highly-nonlinear super-resolution microscopy using a single-beam excitation strategy, and the microscopy principle was modelled and studied based on the ultrahigh nonlinearity enabled by photon avalanches. According to the simulation, the point spread function of highly nonlinear microscopy is switchable among different modes and can shrink three-dimensionally to sub-diffraction scale at the photon avalanche mode. Experimentally, we demonstrated 3D optical nanoscopy assisted with huge optical nonlinearities in a simple laser scanning configuration, achieving a lateral resolution down to 58 nm (λ/14) and an axial resolution down to 185 nm (λ/5) with one single beam of low-power, continuous-wave, near-infrared laser. We further extended the photon avalanche effect to many other emitters to develop multi-color photon avalanching nanoprobes based on migrating photon avalanche mechanism, which enables us to implement single-beam dual-color sub-diffraction super-resolution microscopic imaging.",2023,12,23
[Cariology and Endodontology in China Forges Ahead Together with <i>Chinese Journal of Stomatology</i>].,"The articles related to Cariology and Endodontology published in <i>Chinese Journal of Stomatology</i> from 1953 to July 2023 were summarized.

Towards safer imaging: A comparative study of deep learning-based denoising and iterative reconstruction in intraindividual low-dose CT scans using an in-vivo large animal model.,"Computed tomography (CT) scans are a significant source of medically induced radiation exposure. Novel deep learning-based denoising (DLD) algorithms have been shown to enable diagnostic image quality at lower radiation doses than iterative reconstruction (IR) methods. However, most comparative studies employ low-dose simulations due to ethical constraints. We used real intraindividual animal scans to investigate the dose-reduction capabilities of a DLD algorithm in comparison to IR.",2023,12,19
Psychometric properties of the GAD-7 and PROMIS-Anxiety-4a among youth with depression and suicidality: Results from the Texas youth depression and suicide research network.,"There is a tremendous need for brief, valid, and free assessments of anxiety in child mental healthcare. The goal of this study was to determine the psychometric properties of two such measures, the GAD-7 and PROMIS-Anxiety-4a, in 1000 children, adolescents, and young adults (8-20 years-old) with depression and/or suicidality. The GAD-7, the PROMIS-Anxiety-4a, and other validated assessments of anxiety, physical functioning, and psychiatric diagnoses were completed. Confirmatory factor analyses showed an acceptable fit for a single factor in both measures via all indices but the RMSEA. They demonstrated measurement invariance across pre-adolescents (8-12 years-old) and adolescents and emerging adults (13-20 years-old), though scalar invariance was not observed for the GAD-7. Both measures showed strong convergent validity, GAD-7: r = 0.68; PROMIS-Anxiety-4a: r = 0.75, divergent validity with a measure of physical function, GAD-7: r = -0.24; PROMIS-Anxiety-4a: r = -0.28, good internal consistency, ω = 0.89 for both, and high test-retest reliability, GAD-7: r = 0.69; PROMIS-Anxiety-4a: r = 0.71. Both measures also showed acceptable sensitivity and specificity in detecting the presence of any anxiety disorder, GAD-7 cut-off score of 10: AUC = 0.75; PROMIS-Anxiety-4a cutoff score of 12: AUC = 0.79. The GAD-7 correlated similarly with the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders total score and generalized anxiety subscale, and also showed similar diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when used to detect the presence of any anxiety disorder vs. generalized anxiety disorder specifically. Results suggest that both of these brief, publicly available instruments are valid and reliable assessments of anxiety among youth in treatment for depression and/or suicidality.",2023,12,22
Trace analysis of 47 psychotropic medications in environmental samples by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS).,"Psychotropic medications are one of the most prescribed pharmaceuticals in the world. Given their frequent detection and ecotoxicity to the no-target organism, the emission of these medications into environments has gradually draw attention. The study developed a sensitive and reliable analytic method to simultaneously investigate 47 psychotropic medications in four matrices: wastewater, surface water, activated sludge, and sediment by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). These 47 target analytes include 24 antidepressants, 17 antianxiety drugs, 5 anticonvulsants, and 1 relevant hormone. Solid phase extraction (SPE) was employed to extract analytes from water-phase samples. Ultrasonic Solvent Extraction method with Enhanced Matrix Removal clean-up (USE-EMR) was utilized to extract target compounds from solid-phase samples, which requires more straightforward and convenient procedures than previous methods. The extraction recoveries of all analytes ranged from 80 % to 120 % in these four sample matrices. In this study, The limit of quantitation for 47 psychotropic medications were 0.15 ng/L (estazolam) to 2.27 ng/L (lorazepam), 0.08 ng/L (desvenlafaxine) to 2 ng/L (mianserin), 0.22 ng/g (dry weight, dw) (nordiazepam) to 3.65 ng/g (dw) (lorazepam), and 0.07 ng/g (dw) (carbamazepine) to 2.85 ng/g (lorazepam), in wastewater, surface water, sludge, and sediment, respectively. In addition, the developed method was employed to analyse actual samples in two wastewater treatment plants and their receiving rivers. Carbamazepine, escitalopram, clozapine, desvenlafaxine, diazepam, lamotrigine, sertraline, temazepam, and venlafaxine were nearly ubiquitous in all matrices. Moreover, this study indicated that the inadequate removal efficiencies of psychotropic medications in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) had resulted in a persistent discharge of these contaminants from human sources into environments.",2023,12,30
Folic acid functionalized gadolinium-doped carbon dots as fluorescence / magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent for targeted imaging of liver cancer.,"Gadolinium-doped carbon dots (Gd-CDs), as a new class of nanomaterial, has a wide application prospect in targeted imaging and monitoring diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer because of their good fluorescence (FL)-magnetic resonance (MR) imaging properties. First, Gd-CDs were synthesized by hydrothermal method with gadodiamide as gadolinium source, citric acid as carbon source and silane coupling agent (KH-792) as coupling agent with FL quantum yield (QY) of 48.2%. Then, folic acid (FA), which is highly expressed in liver cancer, was used as a targeting component to modify Gd-CDs to obtain targeted imaging agent (Gd-CDs-FA). The results showed that Gd-CDs and Gd-CDs-FA have low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility, and the targeting and selectivity of Gd-CDs-FA to HepG<sub>2</sub> cells could be observed under confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). The T1 longitudinal relaxation rates (r1) of Gd-CDs and Gd-CDs-FA are 15.92 mM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and 13.56 mM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. They showed good MR imaging ability in vitro and in vivo, and MR imaging in nude mice further proved the targeting imaging performance of Gd-CDs-FA. Therefore, Gd-CDs-FA with higher QY showed good FL-MR targeting imaging ability of liver cancer, which broke through the limitations of single molecular imaging probe in sensitivity and soft tissue resolution. This study provides a new idea for the application of Gd-CDs in FL and MR targeting imaging of liver cancer.",2023,12,22

Cognitive and motor challenges observed in DMD could potentially hinder the execution of dual tasks.",2023,12,19
Reconstruction With Flow-Through Chimeric Anterolateral Thigh Flap Combining Vascularized Fibular Bone Graft for Extensive Composite Tissue Defect of the Forearm: A Case Report.,"The management of critical limb trauma is challenging because limb salvage is preferable to amputation. For upper limb reconstruction, the surgical restoration of functionality, and appearance, a multidisciplinary approach is needed. We report the case of an extensive composite tissue defect of the forearm caused by a machine-crushing injury that was repaired by a flow-through chimeric anterolateral thigh flap with a vascularized fibular graft. Reconstruction was performed as a single-stage procedure; no complications occurred, and both functional and aesthetic outcomes were satisfactory.",2023,12,20
Structural and functional analysis of transforming growth factor beta regulator 1 (TBRG1) in the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii: The initial insight into TBRG1's role in invertebrate immunity.,"The transforming growth factor beta regulator 1 (TBRG1) is a growth inhibitory protein that acts as a tumor suppressor in human cancers, gaining its name for the transcriptional regulation by TGF-β. While extensive research has been conducted on the tumor-related function of TBRG1 in mammals, its significance in invertebrates remains largely unexplored. In this study, a homolog of TBRG1 was first structurally and functionally analyzed in the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii. The full-length cDNA sequence was 2143 base pairs (bp) with a 1305 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a deduced protein of 434 amino acids (aa). The changes of PcTBRG1 transcripts upon immune challenges indicated its involvement in innate immunity. After knocking down PcTBRG1, the decline of bacteria clearance capacity revealed the participation of PcTBRG1 in the immune response. Furthermore, the downregulation of AMPs' expression after the cotreatment of RNAi and bacteria challenge suggested that PcTBRG1 might participate in innate immunity through regulating AMPs' expression. These results provided initial insight into the immune-related function of TBRG1 in invertebrates.",2023,12,31
The role of insulinoma-associated protein 1 in predicting the progression and prognosis of human olfactory neuroblastoma in China.,"Recent studies have suggested that insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) is a useful marker for pathological diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors.

Genome-wide transcriptome profiling of mulberry (Morus alba) response to boron deficiency and toxicity reveal candidate genes associated with boron tolerance in leaves.,"Mulberry (Morus alba) is an essential plant with countless economic benefits; however, its growth and metabolic processes are hampered by boron (B) stresses. Very little research has been performed to elucidate boron tolerance and detoxification mechanisms in this species. The M. alba cultivar, Yu-711, was exposed to five different concentrations of boric acid (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>), including deficient (T1; 0 mM) moderate B deficiency (T2; 0.02 mM), sufficient (CK; 0.1 mM) and toxic (T3 and T4; 0.5 and 1 mM) levels for 18 days of growth in pots experiment. Transcriptome analysis of B deficiency and toxicity treatments was performed on mulberry leaves. The transcriptome data reveal that a total of 6114 genes were differentially expressed (DEGs), of which 3830 were up-regulated and 2284 were down-regulated. A comparative analysis between treatment groups CK-vs-T1 (deficiency) and CK-vs-T4 (toxicity) indicates that 590 and 1383 genes were down-regulated in both deficiency and B toxicity, respectively. The results show that 206 genes were differentially expressed in all treatments. B deficiency and toxicity significantly altered the expression of the key aquaporins (PIP2-1, PIP2-7, PIP2-4 and NIP3-1) and high-affinity boron transporter genes (BOR1 and BOR7). In addition, boron stress also altered the expression of antioxidants and photosynthesis-related genes. B stresses were found to alter several transcription factors including ERF1B, which is associated with the regulation of boron uptake and the synthesis and signaling of phytohormones. Unravelling the mechanisms of B tolerance and detoxification is important and would give us further insight into how B stresses affect mulberry plants.",2023,12,29
Equine chorionic gonadotropin treatment and timed artificial insemination for dairy cow production under heat stress.,"This study investigated the effects of timed artificial insemination (TAI) and equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) administration on lactating dairy cows under heat-stress conditions (average temperature-humidity index: 80). Timed artificial insemination was performed on the cows with (n = 57) or without (control, n = 41) supplementation with 500 IU of eCG at the day of PGF<sub>2α</sub> treatment using the CIDR-Ovsynch protocol. GnRH was administered, and a progesterone device (CIDR) was inserted on Day -10 of the treatment protocol. The CIDR was removed on Day -3, and the cows were treated with PGF<sub>2α</sub>. Two days later, a 2<sup>nd</sup> GnRH injection was administered. Subsequently, AI was performed on Day 0 (16-20 h after the 2<sup>nd</sup> GnRH injection), and pregnancy was diagnosed on Days 32 and 60. Plasma progesterone (P<sub>4</sub>) concentrations were measured after AI. Results showed that the eCG group had a higher pregnancy per AI (P/AI) than the control group (43.9 vs. 12.2%, P = 0.002), which was also accompanied by elevated P<sub>4</sub> levels. Four cows in the eCG group had multiple calves, representing 7.0 and 16.0% of the group and pregnant cows, respectively. In conclusion, 500 IU of eCG combined with CIDR-Ovsynch in lactating dairy cows under severe heat stress conditions successfully improved fertility. However, the protocol may have a slight risk of multiple births.",2023,12,30
Immunocytochemistry on frozen-embedded cell block for the diagnosis of hematolymphoid cytology specimen: a straightforward alternative to the conventional cell block.,"Agarose-based cell block (CB) technique can be modified to be combined with the frozen section technique for the preparation of a high-quality frozen-embedded CB (F-CB) from an effusion or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology sample. This combined technique can be effectively used for the immunocharacterization of the hematolymphoid cells on F-CB. To demonstrate the applicability of performing diagnostic ICC on F-CB, we have analyzed the immunophenotype of the hematolymphoid cells in a series of eight cases of effusions and eight cases of FNA cytology specimens by using CB-ICC on sections cut from frozen-embedded CBs. The SurePath<sup>TM</sup> residue or cytologic material scraped off from the FNA cytology smear that was diagnostic for or suspicious of hematolymphoid malignancy was pelleted and pre-embedded in agarose. Half of the agarose-embedded pellet was frozen-embedded in OCT compound for the preparation of F-CB, while the other half was processed for the preparation of paraffin-embedded CB. Sections cut from the F-CB and P-CB were used for CB-ICC. Panels of ICC on the F-CBs could enable the immunocytochemical differential diagnosis of large cell hematologic malignancies that encompass anaplastic large cell lymphoma and other forms of large-cell hematolymphoid malignancies such as large B-cell lymphomas, anaplastic plasma cell myeloma, myeloid sarcoma, and T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. It also appeared that the small B-cell lymphomas in the effusions or FNAs could be differentially diagnosed with the aid of CB-ICC on the F-CB. A modified agarose-based CB technique can be combined with the frozen-embedded CB method for the preparation of F-CB that can be directly used for the immunocytochemical differential diagnosis of hematolymphoid cytology samples.",2023,12,15
"Silicon and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi alleviate chromium toxicity in Brassica rapa by regulating Cr uptake, antioxidant defense expression, the glyoxalase system, and secondary metabolites.","The potential contribution of silicon (Si) (300 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> potash silica) or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (Rhizophagus irregularis) to reduce chromium toxicity (Cr; 0 and 300 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) in Brassica rapa was examined in this work. Under Cr stress, Si and AMF were used separately and in combination (no Si, or AMF, Si, AMF, and Si + AMF). Brassica rapa growth, colonization, photosynthesis, and physio-biochemical characteristics decreased under Cr stress. Oxidative stress was a side effect of Cr stress and was associated with high levels of methylglyoxal (MG), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), lipid peroxidation (MDA), and maximum lipoxygenase activity (LOX). On the other hand, quantitative real-time PCR analyses of gene expression showed that under Cr stress, the expression of genes for secondary metabolites and antioxidant enzymes was higher than that under the control. The co-application of Si and AMF activated the plant defense system by improving the antioxidative enzymes activities, the potassium citrate and glutathione pool, the glyoxalase system, metabolites, and genes encoding these enzymes under Cr stress. Under the influence of Cr stress, oxidative stress was reduced by the coordinated control of the antioxidant and glyoxalase systems. However, the restricted Cr uptake and root and shoot accumulation of Si and AMF co-applied to only Cr-stressed plants was more significant. In summary, Si and AMF applied together successfully counteract the deleterious effects of Cr stress and restore growth and physio-biochemical characteristics. As a result, the beneficial effects of the combined Si and AMF application may be attributed to mycorrhizae-mediated enhanced Si absorption and metal resistance.",2023,12,24

A novel biopolymer technique for encapsulation of Bacillus velezensis BV9 into double coating biopolymer made by in alginate and natural gums to biocontrol of wheat take-all disease.,"Bacillus velezensis has been known for its high potential in controlling agricultural diseases. Technological advances have opened new perspectives for producing effective formulations by reducing some of the obstacles to their use, such as instability and loss of activity due to exposure to adverse environmental conditions. Encapsulation is one of the new approaches in agricultural science. This research describes discoveries related to processes for the microencapsulation of B. velezensis with natural gums. The efficiency, survival, and controlled release of B. velesensis BV9 encapsulated with alginate mixed with zedo gum, mastic gum, and tragacanth gum were evaluated for this aim. Furthermore, under greenhouse conditions, the encapsulated cells were assessed to control Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici in wheat. The results indicated that all tested microcapsules protected >60 % of the bacterial cells. The Alginate-Zedo Gum (Alg-ZG) microcapsules showed a better-controlled release over two months. The greenhouse study indicated that treating wheat plants with Alg-ZG microcapsules was the most efficient treatment, suppressing 100 % of the pathogen. The results indicated that Alg-ZG is the most promising mixture to improve the survivability of B. velezensis BV9. Also, using natural gums and great potential of this formulation provides an effective and affordable fertilizers for agriculture.",2023,12,06
"Integration of metagenome and metabolome analysis reveals the correlation of gut microbiota, oxidative stress, and inflammation in Coilia nasus under air exposure stress and salinity mitigation.","Due to the strong response to air exposure, high mortality was occurred in Coilia nasus. Previous studies reported that 10 ‰ NaCl could significantly reduce mortality in C. nasus under air exposure. To investigate the mechanisms that 10 ‰ NaCl can alleviate stress, community structure and metabolism of the intestinal flora of C. nasus were detected via metagenome and metabolome. In this study, C. nasus were divided into control group (C), air exposure group without 10 ‰ NaCl (AE), and air exposure group with 10 ‰ NaCl (AES). After air exposure stress and salinity mitigation, the mortality, intestinal microorganisms, metabolites, and physiological biomarkers were analyzed. The results showed that the mortality rate of C. nasus was reduced after salinity reduction; the antioxidant capacity was elevated compared to the AE group; and anti-inflammatory capacity was increased in the AES group compared to the AE group. Metagenomic sequencing results showed that the levels of harmful bacteria (E. coli, Aeromonas) in the Candida nasus gut increased after air exposure; beneficial bacteria (Actinobacteria, Corynebacteria) in the C. nasus gut increased after salinity reduction. Metabolomics analyses showed that AE decreased the expression of beneficial metabolites and increased the expression of harmful metabolites; AES increased beneficial metabolites and decreased harmful metabolites. Correlation analysis showed that in the AE group, beneficial metabolites were negatively correlated with oxidative stress and inflammatory response, while harmful metabolites were positively correlated with oxidative stress and inflammatory response, and were associated with bacterial communities such as Gillisia, Alkalitalia, Avipoxvirus, etc.; the correlation of metabolites with oxidative stress and inflammatory response was opposite to that of AE in the case of AES, and was associated with Lentilactobacillus, Cyanobacterium, and other bacterial communities. Air exposure caused damage to Candida rhinoceros and 10 ‰ salinity was beneficial in alleviating C. nasus stress. These results will provide new insights into methods and mechanisms to mitigate stress in fish.",2023,12,29

Use of percutaneous imaging-guided biopsy for Liver Imaging and Reporting Data System (LI-RADS) observations: A retrospective study from two liver transplant centers.,"Since the adoption of guidelines for the non-invasive imaging diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the need for sampling of a lesion in cirrhosis has decreased. We aimed to retrospectively investigate the use of percutaneous imaging-guided biopsy for LI-RADS observations in cirrhosis in two large liver transplant centers. A review of the pathology database in the two Institutions (Institution A, Institution B) was conducted to identify patients that underwent percutaneous imaging-guided biopsy for a liver lesion in the interval time 01/01/2015-12/312020. Liver observations on pre-procedure contrast-enhanced CT or MRI were classified according to LI-RADS v2018. Among the 728 patients who underwent imaging guided biopsy of a liver lesion in Institution A, and among the 749 patients who underwent imaging guided biopsy of a liver lesion in Institution B, respectively 50 (6.8 %) and 16 (2.1 %) were cirrhotic with available pre-procedural contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. A total of 67 lesions were biopsied. 30/67 (45 %) biopsied observations were classified as LR-M. 55/67 (82 %) biopsies were positive for malignancy at histopathology and among them 33 (60 %) were HCC. In conclusion, a small percentage of percutaneous, imaging-guided biopsies for liver lesions are performed in cirrhosis, and more frequently for LR-M observations.",2023,12,20
[Inhibitory effect of <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> antisense vicK RNA regulating the cariogenicity of oral streptococci multi-species biofilm].,"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the inhibitory effects of <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> (<i>Sm</i>) antisense vicK RNA (ASvicK) on the multi-species biofilm formed by three common oral streptococci (Sm, <i>Streptococcus sanguinis</i>, and <i>Streptococcus gordonii</i>) (Sm+Ss+Sg). <b>Methods:</b> ASvicK over-expression strain was constructed by using a recombinant plasmid, and three-species biofilm UA159+Ss+Sg and ASvicK+Ss+Sg were cultured. The phenotypes of biofilm were detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Crystal violet (CV) assay was used to detect biomass of the biofilm. Lactate kit and anthrone-sulfuric acid colorimetric assay were used to determine the abilities of lactic acid production and EPS metabolism, respectively. The proportions of three-species and expression levels of the cariogenic-related genes in biofilms were detected by Taqman fluorescence quantitative PCR (Taqman-qPCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). A biofilm demineralization model of human enamel slabs was further constructed, and the hardness of enamel surface was detected. <b>Results:</b> Compared to UA159+Ss+Sg, over-expression of ASvicK could inhibit biofilm formation and lactic acid production in ASvicK+Ss+Sg biofilm significantly by 78.93% (<i>P<</i>0.001) and 62.23% (<i>P<</i>0.001), respectively. With ASvicK over-expression, the amounts of water-insoluble and-soluble glucoses in ASvicK+Ss+Sg biofilm reduced respectively by 39.13% (<i>P<</i>0.001) and 68.00% (<i>P<</i>0.001) compared to the control. And with ASvicK over-expression, the proportion of Sm, the cariogenic bacteria, showed 33.00% reduction (<i>P<</i>0.01) in Sm+Ss+Sg biofilm, and the gene expressions of cariogenic-relative genes vicK/X, gtfB/C/D, and ftf significantly decreased (<i>P<</i>0.05). The micro-hardness value of enamel slabs after demineralization by ASvicK+Ss+Sg biofilm was significantly 1.83 times higher than that of group UA159+Ss+Sg (<i>P<</i>0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> ASvicK could reduce the Sm proportion and weaken the cariogenicity of oral Streptococcus biofilms, thereby possibly slowing down the progress of caries.",2023,12,29
Synthesis and antitumor activity of cyclopentane-fused anthraquinone derivatives.,"In our pursuit of developing novel analogs of anthracyclines with enhanced antitumor efficacy and safety, we have designed a synthesis scheme for 4,11-dihydroxy-5,10-dioxocyclopenta[b]anthracene-2-carboxamides. These newly synthesized compounds exhibit remarkable antiproliferative potency against various mammalian tumor cell lines, including those expressing activated mechanisms of multidrug resistance. The structure of the diamine moiety in the carboxamide side chain emerges as a critical determinant for anticancer activity and interaction with key targets such as DNA, topoisomerase 1, and ROS induction. Notably, the introduced modification to the doxorubicin structure results in significantly increased lipophilicity, cellular uptake, and preferential distribution in lysosomes. Consequently, while maintaining an impact on anthracyclines targets, these novel derivatives also demonstrate the potential to induce cytotoxicity through pathways associated with lysosomes. In summary, derivatives of cyclic diamines, particularly 3-aminopyrrolidine, can be considered a superior choice compared to aminosugars for incorporation into natural and semi-synthetic anthracyclines or new anthraquinone derivatives, aiming to circumvent efflux-mediated drug resistance.",2023,12,30
An improved Bi-LSTM method based on heterogeneous features fusion and attention mechanism for ECG recognition.,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a critical role in early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. However, extracting powerful deep features from ECG signal for recognition is still a challenging problem today due to the variable abnormal rhythms and noise distribution. This work proposes a Bi-LSTM algorithm based on heterogeneous features fusion and attention mechanism (HFFAM + Bi-LSTM). Combining the empirical features and the features learned by the deep learning network, HFFAM + Bi-LSTM can comprehensively extract the temporal frequency information and spatial structure information of the ECG signal. Meanwhile, a novel attention mechanism based on improved DTW (AM-DTW) is designed to analyze and control the fusion process of features. The role of AM-DTW in HFFAM + Bi-LSTM is twofold, one is to measure the feature similarity between ECG signal sets with different labels using the improved DTW, and the other is to distinguish the features into isomorphic and heterogeneous features as well as adaptive weighting of the features. It is worth mentioning that overly similar isomorphic features are filtered out to further optimize the algorithm. Thus, HFFAM + Bi-LSTM has the advantage of strengthening the heterogeneous information in the feature subspace while accounting for the isomorphic features. The accuracy of HFFAM + Bi-LSTM reaches up to 98.1 % and 97.1 % on the simulated and real datasets, respectively. Compared to the all benchmark models, the classification accuracy of HFFAM + Bi-LSTM is 1.3 % higher than the best. The experiments also demonstrate that HFFAM + Bi-LSTM has better performance compared with existing methods, which provides a new scheme for automatic detection of ECG signal.",2023,12,28
"Poly (3, 4-propylenedioxythiophene)/Hollow carbon sphere composites supported Pt NPs to facilitate methanol oxidation reactions.","Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are thought of as portable, sustainable, and non-polluting energy devices. The exploration of efficient and affordable catalysts for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is significant for the industrial application of DMFCs. In this study, nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres (HCS) derived from polydopamine were proposed for the catalyst support for platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) for serving as the anode catalyst for DMFCs, and a composite support material was fabricated by in-situ oxidation of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) with HCS to get core-shell structured poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT)-embellished hollow carbon spheres (HCS) (PProDOT/HCS) for further improving the catalytic activity for supported catalyst. The results indicated that the platinum (Pt) on the surface of HCS was well dispersed, and the Pt became smaller and more evenly distributed with the introduction of PProDOT. Simultaneously, the Schottky junction formed between PProDOT and Pt NPs contributes to enhanced charge transfer and catalytic activity of the catalyst. Notably, the core-shell structure of the ternary catalyst, its excellent charge transfer capability, and the interaction between platinum and the support contribute to its high electrocatalytic activity. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the PProDOT/HCS/Pt catalyst exhibited a mass activity of 1169.6 mA mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pt</sub> for methanol oxidation in acidic electrolytes, surpassing the activity of the HCS/Pt catalyst (472.4 mA mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pt</sub>) and commercial Pt/C (281.0 mA mg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pt</sub>).",2023,12,30

Endoscopic Gastric Plication: A Flexible and Tailored Alternative to Bariatric Surgery.,"Endoscopic procedures are expanding and have been evolving in recent years, increasing their volume along with the development of new devices. This is due to the low morbidity and complication rate, the reversibility of the procedures, and the positive impact on patients. Among the endoscopic procedures gaining interest is sleeve gastroplasty. It emerged as a feasible and safe alternative to traditional bariatric surgery.

Biological upcycling of nickel and sulfate as electrocatalyst from electroplating wastewater.,"Upcycling nickel (Ni) to useful catalyst is an appealing route to realize low-carbon treatment of electroplating wastewater and simultaneously recovering Ni resource, but has been restricted by the needs for costly membranes or consumption of large amount of chemicals in the existing upcycling processes. Herein, a biological upcycling route for synchronous recovery of Ni and sulfate as electrocatalysts, with certain amount of ferric salt (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) added to tune the product composition, is proposed. Efficient biosynthesis of bio-NiFeS nanoparticles from electroplating wastewater was achieved by harnessing the sulfate reduction and metal detoxification ability of Desulfovibrio vulgaris. The optimal bio-NiFeS, after further annealing at 300 °C, served as an efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst, achieving a current density of 10 mA·cm<sup>-1</sup> at an overpotential of 247 mV and a Tafel slope of 60.2 mV·dec<sup>-1</sup>. It exhibited comparable electrocatalytic activity with the chemically-synthesized counterparts and outperformed the commercial RuO<sub>2</sub>. The feasibility of the biological upcycling approach for treating real Ni-containing electroplating wastewater was also demonstrated, achieving 99.5 % Ni<sup>2+</sup>removal and 41.0 % SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> removal and enabling low-cost fabrication of electrocatalyst. Our work paves a new path for sustainable treatment of Ni-containing wastewater and may inspire technology innovations in recycling/ removal of various metal ions.",2023,12,23
Second-order calibration high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace molecular absorption spectrometry-based determination of bromine and fluorine.,"In this study, we report the simultaneous determination of bromine and fluorine using Second-Order Calibration High-Resolution Continuum Source Graphite Furnace Molecular Absorption Spectrometry (HR CS MAS). The instrumental data acquired correspond to the time versus wavelength matrix per sample that were analyzed using Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC), along with Unfold and N-way Partial Least Squares combined with a post-calibration step known as Residual Bilinearization (U and N PLS/RBL). Despite the significant difference in sensitivity between bromine and fluorine, all approaches provided reasonably accurate results when predicting both analytes in synthetic mixtures within a controlled environment. The relative prediction error (REP) values for bromine were 29.8 % (PARAFAC), 23.6 % (N-PLS/RBL), and 13.1 % (U-PLS/RBL), while for fluorine, the REP values were 3.4 % (PARAFAC), 3.5 % (N-PLS/RBL), and 3.2 % (U-PLS/RBL). When applying this approach to predict unknown samples, a comparison was made between the estimated nominal concentrations of fluorine and bromine obtained using either a reference method or based on labeled values or spiked mass, and those obtained using the proposed method. It was observed that PARAFAC was unable to predict the samples accurately, whereas the REP values for the prediction of bromine and fluorine using N-PLS/RBL and U-PLS/RBL methods were 19.3 %/19.2 % and 13.6 %/13.1 %, respectively.",2023,12,28
Interfacial oxygen atom modification of a PdSn alloy to boost oxygen reduction in zinc-air batteries.,"Modifying the surface of a catalyst with heteroatoms can regulate the interfacial atomic valence state and adjust the charge distribution, which is promising for obtaining desirable platinum carbon catalyst (Pt/C)-matched oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic performance. Here, we developed an efficient method to access O-rich crystalline interfacial-exposed palladium-tin alloy (111) crystal surfaces [Pd<sub>3</sub>Sn (111)] for highly efficient ORR via direct reduction of Pd/Sn metal salt species that are well dispersed in a nitrogen, phosphorus-doped carbonaceous (NPC) substrate. In addition to the other materials, preembedded Pd/Sn metal salt species in NPC control the release of metal sources upon reduction in the liquid phase, resulting in the grafting of an as-prepared PdSn alloy with many merits, such as efficient electron conduction, short-range crystallinity and increased crystal interface exposure. The presence of a considerable quantity of oxygen atoms at the interface of small-sized PdSn alloys on NPC substrates has been methodically verified by powder X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations. The PdSn-O sample exhibited excellent ORR activity, achieving an onset potential of ∼0.99 V and a half-wave potential of ∼0.88 V at 1600 rpm in O<sub>2</sub>-saturated 1.0 M KOH. Density functional theory simulations of pure Pd, Pd-O, the PdSn alloy and PdSn-O suggest that interfacial oxygen atom modification is responsible for the significantly improved ORR activity. The assembled zinc-air battery provides a high specific power of 218.9 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> and a specific capacity of 810.6 mAh g<sub>Zn</sub><sup>-1</sup>. Our approach has the potential to stimulate the preparation of O-rich crystalline interfacial-exposed alloy compounds for other energy conversion applications.",2023,12,30
Nitrate removal by anammox bacteria utilizing photoexcited electrons via inward extracellular electron transfer channel.,"Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) has been found to occur in some anammox bacteria species, and the DNRA metabolites (nitrite and ammonium) can further be removed to nitrogen from water. However, the activation of DNRA pathway of anammox bacteria is usually limited by the access to electron donors. Herein, we constructed a photosensitized hybrid system combining anammox bacteria (Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis and Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans) with CdS nanoparticles semiconductor for energy-efficient NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removal. Such photosensitized anammox-CdS hybrid systems achieved NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removal with an average efficiency of 88% (the maximum of 91%) and a N<sub>2</sub> selectivity of 72%, only with photoexcited electrons as donors. The DNRA-anammox metabolism of anammox bacteria was proved to responsible for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removal via inward extracellular electron transfer channel. The greatly up-regulated genes encoding c-type cytochrome proteins (5 or 11 hemes) in the outer membrane, c-type cytochrome protein (4 hemes) and electron transport protein RnfA-E in the inner membrane, ferredoxin (2Fe-2S) in the cytoplasm and c-type cytochrome bc<sub>1</sub> in anammoxosome membrane were supposed to play key roles in the inward extracellular electron transfer pathway. This work provides a novel insight into the design of the biotic-abiotic hybrid photosynthetic systems, and opens a new strategy for light-driven NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removal from the perspective of light energy input.",2023,12,23
DIET-like and MIET-like mutualism of S. oneidensis MR-1 and metal-reducing function microflora boosts Cr(VI) reduction.,"Microbial treatment of Cr(VI) is an environmentally friendly and low-cost approach. However, the mechanism of mutualism and the role of interspecies electron transfer in Cr(VI) reducing microflora are unclear. Herein, we constructed an intersymbiotic microbial association flora to augment interspecies electron transfer via functionalizing electroactive Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 with metal-reducing microflora, and thus the efficiency of Cr(VI) reduction. The findings suggest that the metal-reducing active microflora could converts glucose into lactic acid and riboflavin for S. oneidensis MR-1 to act as a carbon source and electron mediator. Thus, when adding initial 25 mg/L Cr (VI), this microflora exhibited an outstanding Cr (VI) removal efficiency (100%) at 12 h and elevated Cr (III) immobilization efficiency (80%) at 60 h with the assistance of 25 mg/L Cu(II). A series of electrochemical experiments proved this remarkable removal efficiency were ascribed to the improved interspecies electron transfer efficiency through direct interspecies electron transfer and riboflavin through mediated interspecies electron transfer. Furthermore, the metagenomic analysis revealed the expression level of the electron transport pathway was promoted. Intriguing high abundance of genes participating in the bio-reduction and biotransformation of Cr(VI) was also observed in functional microflora. These outcomes give a novel strategy for enhancing the reduction and fixation of harmful heavy metals by coculturing function microflora with electrogenic microorganisms.",2023,12,29
Space-feature measures on meshes for mapping spatial transcriptomics.,"Advances in the development of largely automated microscopy methods such as MERFISH for imaging cellular structures in mouse brains are providing spatial detection of micron resolution gene expression. While there has been tremendous progress made in the field of Computational Anatomy (CA) to perform diffeomorphic mapping technologies at the tissue scales for advanced neuroinformatic studies in common coordinates, integration of molecular- and cellular-scale populations through statistical averaging via common coordinates remains yet unattained. This paper describes the first set of algorithms for calculating geodesics in the space of diffeomorphisms, what we term space-feature-measure LDDMM, extending the family of large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) algorithms to accommodate a space-feature action on marked particles which extends consistently to the tissue scales. It leads to the derivation of a cross-modality alignment algorithm of transcriptomic data to common coordinate systems attached to standard atlases. We represent the brain data as geometric measures, termed as space-feature measures supported by a large number of unstructured points, each point representing a small volume in space and carrying a list of densities of features elements of a high-dimensional feature space. The shape of space-feature measure brain spaces is measured by transforming them by diffeomorphisms. The metric between these measures is obtained after embedding these objects in a linear space equipped with the norm, yielding a so-called ""chordal metric"".",2023,12,23
Real-time estimation of lung deformation from body surface using a general CoordConv CNN.,"Estimating the three-dimensional (3D) deformation of the lung is important for accurate dose delivery in radiotherapy and precise surgical guidance in lung surgery navigation.

However, this results in increased radiation dose. Therefore, we propose a novel method that estimates lung tissue deformation from depth maps and two CT phases per patient.",2023,12,29
To what extent does freezing impact the mid-infrared signature of urine? Case of patients attending urology department.,"Urine is a very interesting and attractive biofluid for biomarker discovery and medical diagnosis research due to its non-invasiveness collection and richness of potential biomarkers. Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy applied on urine samples is a promising tool that could be used as a screening method for various diseases. However, during method development, frozen urine is more accessible, especially for inter-laboratory studies, whereas in routine application fresh urine is more convenient. Here, the objective of our work is to evaluate the freezing impact on mid-infrared signature of urine samples. Therefore, both fresh and frozen urine samples from twenty patients were analysed in a dried form. These samples were collected from patients consulting for cystoscopy examination. Simultaneously, centrifugation was also conducted on 10 of all included patients. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that patient inter-variabilities are higher than variability due to the freezing step. Then, Euclidean distance between fresh and frozen urine of each patient highlighted that the impact of freezing is different from one patient to another. Adding the centrifugation step slightly minimized intra-patient variability compared to not centrifugated samples. This study contributes to define experimental conditions for urine analysis development for translational application in biomedical field.",2023,12,28
Effects of Parental Psychological Control on Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help in Senior High School Students: Serial Mediating Effects of Rejection Sensitivity and Social Withdrawal.,"The purpose of the current study was to examine the serial mediating effects of rejection sensitivity and social withdrawal on parental psychological control and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help among senior high school students. In November 2022, 648 students completed a self-report questionnaire. The parental psychological control scale, senior high school students' rejection sensitivity scale, social withdrawal scale, and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help scale were used for measurement. Correlation analysis showed parental psychological control and rejection sensitivity were positively correlated with social withdrawal (<i>r</i> = 0.387, 0.466, 0.495, all <i>p</i> < 0.001). Parental psychological control and rejection sensitivity were significantly negatively correlated with social withdrawal and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help (<i>r</i> = -0.325, -0.324, -0.397, all <i>p</i> < 0.001). Mediating effect analysis indicated that parental psychological control had a significant direct effect on attitude toward seeking professional psychological help, and rejection sensitivity and social withdrawal had significant serial mediating effects among parental psychological control and attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help in senior high school students. These aspects warrant attention as they play significant roles in influencing students' willingness to seek psychological assistance.

[Research progress on molecular mechanism of palatal development].,"Cleft palate is one of the most common maxillofacial birth defects, which can occur alone or accompany with many known deformities. Palatal selves need to complete the process of vertical growth, elevation, adhesion and fusion in a specific time window of embryo development. Any abnormality in this process will lead to cleft palate. Although previous studies have identified many molecular networks that regulate the growth, location and fusion of palatal selves, there are still many unknown mechanisms for palatal development. The pathogenesis of cleft palate has not been clarified so far. In recent years, the molecular research on the development of palatal development has been deepened continuously. Here we summarize major recent advances and integrate the genes and molecular pathways with the cellular and morphogenetic processes of palatal shelf growth, patterning, elevation, adhesion, and fusion, in order to comprehensively understand the genotype-phenotype functional relationship and provide assistance in formulating effective prevention strategies for cleft palate disease.",2023,12,29

Development of Diagnostic Quality Metrics for Prosthetic Joint Infection.,"Although well-accepted clinical practice guidelines exist for the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection (PJI), little is known about the quality of diagnosis for PJI. The identification of quality gaps in the diagnosis of PJI would facilitate the development of care structures and processes to shorten time to diagnosis and reduce the significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden associated with this condition. Hence, we sought to develop valid clinical quality measures to improve the timeliness and accuracy of PJI diagnosis. We convened a nine-member multidisciplinary national panel of PJI experts including orthopedic surgeons, infectious disease specialists, an emergency medicine physician, and a patient previously treated for PJI to review, discuss, and rate the validity of proposed measures using a modification of the RAND-UCLA appropriateness method. In total, 57 permutations of six proposed measures were rated. Populations considered to be at high enough risk for PJI that certain care processes should always be performed were identified by the panel. Among the proposed quality measures, the panel rated five as valid. These novel clinical quality measures could provide insight into care gaps in the diagnosis of PJI.",2023,12,06
Lung adenocarcinoma metastasis within a pituitary neuroendocrine tumor: a case report with review of literature.,"Collision tumors involving the metastasis of malignant neoplasms to pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) are extremely rare. We herein report a case involving a patient with lung adenocarcinoma metastasis within a PitNET who exhibited relatively rapid progression of neurological symptoms. A 75-year-old man who underwent tumor resection 36 and 18 years prior to presentation for bladder and colon cancer, respectively, without recurrence presented with bitemporal hemianopsia, ptosis, and diplopia of the right eye. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a tumor 3.2 cm in diameter that extended from the anterior pituitary gland to the suprasellar region. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the tumor showed heterogeneous contrast enhancement. Considering the relatively rapid progression of neurological symptoms, semi-emergency endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery was performed. Histopathological examination revealed a group of thyroid transcription factor-1- and napsin A-positive papillary proliferating cells intermingled with α-subunit- and steroidogenic factor-1-positive PitNET cells. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma metastasis within a gonadotroph PitNET. Genetic testing revealed the presence of an EGFR (Ex-19del) mutation, after which chemotherapy was initiated. Additional stereotactic radiotherapy was performed for the residual tumor in the sella turcica. With continued chemotherapy, good control of both the primary and metastatic tumors was noted after 24 months after surgery. Cases of malignant neoplasm metastasis within a PitNET are difficult to diagnose. In the case of a sella turcica tumor with relatively rapid progression of neurological symptoms, early surgical intervention is recommended given the possibility of a highly proliferative tumor and the need to obtain pathologic specimens.",2023,12,29
Aptamers for nanobodies: A nontoxic alternative to toxic ochratoxin A in immunoassays.,"To measure toxins using immunoassays, hazardous toxin standards need to be added for quantification. To solve this problem, we propose to use aptamers as competitors to replace toxin standards. In this work, aptamers specific for ochratoxin A (OTA) nanobodies were selected using a DNA library containing a 36 nucleotide random region. The obtained sequences were highly aligned and the best competitor was identified to be a sequence named apt2-OT based on an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The K<sub>d</sub> of apt2-OT was measured to be 2.86 μM using local surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. The optimal apt2-OT was identified to substitute the OTA standard with a concentration needed for 50% inhibition of binding (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 3.26 μM based on a nontoxic direct competitive ELISA. The equivalence relationship between the aptamer and OTA was established in a flour sample, and a recovery experiment was performed. The detection limit for this method was 0.23 ng/mL, with a linear range from 0.25 to 10.50 ng/mL. The recovery rate was 97.5%-115.5%. This study provides a low-cost, rapid and environmentally friendly alternative to the development of immunoassays for toxins.",2023,12,30

Photochromic biomaterials: Synthesis and fluorescence properties of spiroxanthenes-grafted alginate derivatives.,"Herein, we reported a general and green synthetic strategy for photochromic functional alginate derivatives grafting with isoindolinone spiroxanthenes. Under mild condition, diverse 2-aminoalkyl isoindolinone spiroxanthene derivatives have been prepared from organic photochromic isobenzofuranone spiroxanthenes (including rhodamine B, rhodamine 6G and fluorescein), and grafted on alginate chains through amidation reaction using diamine as a linkage with water as a green solvent at room temperature. The photochromic properties of the fluorophores-modified polymers and the effect of pH value have been explored. Under acid conditions, the spiroisoindolinone rings of alginate derivatives are opened resulting in showing absorption bands and fluorescence with orange to green emission, while the alginate derivatives turned to colourless under basic conditions which is reversibly. In addition to biodegradability and biocompatibility, the polymers exhibit good film-forming properties simultaneously. The films and fibers produced from the alginate derivatives also project good fluorescence properties.",2023,12,08
Structural neural connectivity correlates with pre-reading abilities in preschool children.,"Pre-reading abilities are predictive of later reading ability and can be assessed before reading begins. However, the neural correlates of pre-reading abilities in young children are not fully understood. To address this, we examined 246 datasets collected in an accelerated longitudinal design from 81 children aged 2-6 years (age = 4.6 ± 0.98 years, 47 males). Children completed pre-reading assessments (NEPSY-II Phonological Processing and Speeded Naming) and underwent a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to assess white matter connectivity. We defined a core neural network of reading and language regions based on prior literature, and structural connections within this network were assessed using graph theory analysis. Linear mixed models accounting for repeated measures were used to test associations between children's pre-reading performance and graph theory measures for the whole bilateral reading network and each hemisphere separately. Phonological Processing scores were positively associated with global efficiency, local efficiency, and clustering coefficient in the bilateral and right hemisphere networks, as well as local efficiency and clustering coefficient in the left hemisphere network. Our findings provide further evidence that structural neural correlates of Phonological Processing emerge in early childhood, before and during early reading instruction.",2023,12,21
A nationwide investigation on the characteristics and health risk of trace elements in surface water across China.,"Rapid urbanization accelerates the release of anthropogenic heavy metals from local to wider water systems, posing a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems and public health. The characteristics of trace elements were investigated to evaluate the environmental status of surface water in 40 cities of China. The concentrations of 22 elements in surface water ranged from 7.00 × 10<sup>-4</sup> to 4.37 × 10<sup>5</sup> μg/L. The water quality can be classified as ""excellent"" except Songhuajiang. The levels of As, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Hg are all within the limits permitted by national drinking water quality standards. An obvious regional distribution characteristic was observed, with concentrations of Zn, Mn, Ni, Cu, Co, U, and Cr higher in surface water collected in the north than in the south, while the trends for Cd, Tl, and As are opposite. Notably, Tl shows significant geographical divergences, with the level of surface water collected from the south nine times higher than that from the north. The regional distribution of the mineral, industrial, or agricultural activity might be responsible for the south-to-north difference of these elements. The hazard index (HI) and total cancer risk (TCR) through oral or dermal contact with water-related heavy metals were further calculated. The average HI was 0.54 in the north and 0.29 in the south for adults, while HI for children was relatively higher. The value was 1.01 and 0.55 in the north and south, respectively. TCR in the north is 2.58 × 10<sup>-4</sup> and mainly contributed by Cr (88.1 %), while TCR in the south is 4.48 × 10<sup>-5</sup> and mainly contributed by As (98.4 %). The research results can provide essential data for effective water resources management and human health protection in China.",2023,12,27

Study on the mechanism of natural polysaccharides on the deastringent effect of Triphala extract.,"This present study investigated the masking effect of high methoxyl pectin, xanthan gum, and gum Arabic on the astringency of the traditional herbal formula Triphala and further examined the mechanism of polysaccharide reducing astringency. Results of sensory evaluation and electronic tongue illustrated that 0.6 % pectin, 0.3 % xanthan gum, and 2 % gum Arabic had a substantial deastringent effect. The polyphenols in Triphala are basically hydrolysable tannins, which with high degree of gallic acylation may be the main astringent component of Triphala. Moreover, the three polysaccharides can combine with β-casein through CO and NH groups to form soluble binary complexes and decrease the secondary structure of β-casein. When polysaccharides were added to the Triphala-protein system, polyphenol-protein precipitation was also diminished, and they were capable of forming soluble ternary complexes. Consequently, the competition between polysaccharides and polyphenols for binding salivary proteins and the formation of ternary complexes help decrease the astringency of Triphala.",2023,12,30

Establishment and visual analysis of CBA/J-Pde6b<sup>Y347Y/Y347X</sup> and C3H/HeJ-Pde6b<sup>Y347Y/Y347X</sup> mice.,"In CBA/J and C3H/HeJ mice, retinitis pigmentosa is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait due to a mutation in Pde6b, which encodes cGMP phosphodiesterase subunit b. In these strains, the Y347X mutation in Pde6b leads to the upregulation of cGMP levels, increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induces rod death, and the outer segment and rod cells entirely disappeared by 35 days after birth. In the present study, we utilized the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas)9-mediated gene editing to repair the Y347X mutation in CBA/J and C3H/HeJ mice. Evaluation of the established CBA/J-Pde6b <sup>Y347Y/Y347X</sup> and C3H/HeJ-Pde6b <sup>Y347Y/Y347X</sup> mice, which were confirmed to have normal retinal layers by live fundoscopic imaging and histopathological analysis, revealed improved visual acuity based on the visual cliff and light/dark transition tests. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that the visible platform test was a more effective tool for testing visual behavior in these mice. The results suggest that the established strains can serve as control groups for CBA/J and C3H/HeJ in ophthalmology studies involving retinitis pigmentosa.",2023,12,28
"Laying performance, genetic parameters, and the expression of FSHβ, LHβ, FSHR, and LHR genes in Japanese quails selected for early egg production.","Investigating the impact of early egg production selection (the first 90 d of laying) on egg production features, cumulative selection response (CSR), and the mRNA expression of gonadotropins (FSHβ and LHβ), and their receptors (FSHR and LHR), in Japanese quails was the goal. The selection experiment involved 1293  females in all, 257 from the base group and 1036 from the 4 selected generations. Age and body weight at sexual maturity (ASM, BWSM), weight of the first egg (WFE), days to the first 10 eggs (DF10E), egg mass for the first 10 eggs (EMF10E), egg weight (EW), egg number at the first 90 d of laying (EN90D), and egg mass at the first 90 d of laying (EM90D) were all recorded. Most egg production traits had heritability estimates that were low to moderate and ranged from 0.17 to 0.33., where the highest estimates were reported for EN90D (0.33) and BWSM (0.32). With the exception of EN90D, low to moderate positive genetic correlations were observed between ASM and other egg production traits (0.17-0.44). The fourth generation showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower ASM and DF10E but higher BWSM, WFE, EN90D, EM10E, and EM90D when compared with the base generation. CSR were significant (P < 0.05) for ASM (-6.67 d), BWSM (27.13 g), WFE (0.93 g), DF10E (-1.25 d), EN90D (7.24 egg), EM10E (10.57 g), and EM90D (140.0 g). FSHβ, LHβ, FSHR, and LHR gene mRNA expression was considerably (P < 0.05) greater in the fourth generation compared to the base generation. In conclusion, selection programs depending on the efficiency of egg production (EN90D) could improve the genetic gain of egg production traits and upregulate the mRNA expression of FSHβ, LHβ, FSHR, and LHR genes in selected quails (fourth generation). These findings might help to enhance breeding plans and create commercial lines of high egg production Japanese quails.",2023,12,06
Rapid and in-situ preparation COFs coated capillary by adsorption method for the separation and determination of phthalate ester using CEC.,"As a novel class of stationary phase materials, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown great promise in open-tubular capillary electrochromatography. However, the current preparation of COFs coating capillaries heavily relies on tedious and time-consuming covalent bond methods. In this work, a novel, simple and rapid adsorption method was developed for fabrication of TPB-DMTP COF (fabricated from 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene (TPB) and 2,5-dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (DMTP)) coated capillary. Due to the crystallization process of the COF is greatly shortened because pre-modification capillary does not require silane coupling agent, this method enables the rapid preparation of COFs-coated capillaries. The organic molecular building units only need 25 min to form a stable COFs coating on the inner wall of a capillary by this method. To our knowledge, this is the shortest method for preparing COFs coated capillary up to now. The performance of the TPB-DMTP COF coated capillary was evaluated by using phthalate esters as model analytes. The results demonstrated that the TPB-DMTP COF coated capillary has excellent repeatability and stability. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the analyte's retention time of intra-day, inter-day and column-to-column were in the range of 0.05 %-0.27 %, 0.31 %-0.63 % and 0.31 %-0.88 %, respectively. And, no significant changes were observed in separation efficiency and retention time after over 200 runs. Finally, the TPB-DMTP COF coated capillary was applied for the determination of phthalates in marketed plastic bag and the recovery ranged from 88.0 % to 114.0 %.",2023,12,30
Effect of proline content and histidine ligation on the dynamics of Ω-loop D and the peroxidase activity of iso-1-cytochrome c.,"To study how proline residues affect the dynamics of Ω-loop D (residues 70 to 85) of cytochrome c, we prepared G83P and G83A variants of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c (iso-1-Cytc) in the presence and absence of a K73H mutation. Ω-loop D is important in controlling both the electron transfer function of Cytc and the peroxidase activity of Cytc used in apoptosis because it provides the Met80 heme ligand. The G83P and G83A mutations have no effect on the global stability of iso-1-Cytc in presence or absence of the K73H mutation. However, both mutations destabilize the His73-mediated alkaline conformer relative to the native state. pH jump stopped-flow experiments show that the dynamics of the His73-mediated alkaline transition are significantly enhanced by the G83P mutation. Gated electron transfer studies show that the enhanced dynamics result from an increased rate of return to the native state, whereas the rate of loss of Met80 ligation is unchanged by the G83P mutation. Thus, the G83P substitution does not stiffen the conformation of the native state. Because bis-His heme ligation occurs when Cytc binds to cardiolipin-containing membranes, we studied the effect of His73 ligation on the peroxidase activity of Cytc, which acts as an early signal in apoptosis by causing oxygenation of cardiolipin. We find that the His73 alkaline conformer suppresses the peroxidase activity of Cytc. Thus, the bis-His ligated state of Cytc formed upon binding to cardiolipin is a negative effector for the peroxidase activity of Cytc early in apoptosis.",2023,12,28
Attention De-sparsification Matters: Inducing diversity in digital pathology representation learning.,"We propose DiRL, a Diversity-inducing Representation Learning technique for histopathology imaging. Self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques, such as contrastive and non-contrastive approaches, have been shown to learn rich and effective representations of digitized tissue samples with limited pathologist supervision. Our analysis of vanilla SSL-pretrained models' attention distribution reveals an insightful observation: sparsity in attention, i.e, models tends to localize most of their attention to some prominent patterns in the image. Although attention sparsity can be beneficial in natural images due to these prominent patterns being the object of interest itself, this can be sub-optimal in digital pathology; this is because, unlike natural images, digital pathology scans are not object-centric, but rather a complex phenotype of various spatially intermixed biological components. Inadequate diversification of attention in these complex images could result in crucial information loss. To address this, we leverage cell segmentation to densely extract multiple histopathology-specific representations, and then propose a prior-guided dense pretext task, designed to match the multiple corresponding representations between the views. Through this, the model learns to attend to various components more closely and evenly, thus inducing adequate diversification in attention for capturing context-rich representations. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis on multiple tasks across cancer types, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method and observe that the attention is more globally distributed.",2023,12,28
MLMSeg: A multi-view learning model for ultrasound thyroid nodule segmentation.,"Accurate segmentation of the thyroid gland in ultrasound images is an essential initial step in distinguishing between benign and malignant nodules, thus facilitating early diagnosis. Most existing deep learning-based methods to segment thyroid nodules are learned from only a single view or two views, which limits the performance of segmenting nodules at different scales in complex ultrasound scanning environments. To address this limitation, this study proposes a multi-view learning model, abbreviated as MLMSeg. First, a deep convolutional neural network is introduced to encode the features of the local view. Second, a multi-channel transformer module is designed to capture long-range dependency correlations of global view between different nodules. Third, there are semantic relationships of structural view between features of different layers. For example, low-level features and high-level features are endowed with hidden relationships in the feature space. To this end, a cross-layer graph convolutional module is proposed to adaptively learn the correlations of high-level and low-level features by constructing graphs across different layers. In addition, in the view fusion, a channel-aware graph attention block is devised to fuse the features from the aforementioned views for accurate segmentation of thyroid nodules. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive comparative experiments were conducted with 14 baseline methods. MLMSeg achieved higher Dice coefficients (92.10% and 83.84%) and Intersection over Union scores (86.60% and 73.52%) on two different thyroid datasets. The exceptional segmentation capability of MLMSeg for thyroid nodules can greatly assist in localizing thyroid nodules and facilitating more precise measurements of their transverse and longitudinal diameters, which is of significant clinical relevance for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules.",2023,12,28
ADAR-mediated RNA editing regulates PVR immune checkpoint in colorectal cancer.,"Recent studies have revealed that tumor immunotherapy resistance is influenced by ADAR-mediated RNA editing, but its targets remain unelucidated. Our current study identified the poliovirus receptor (PVR) oncogene, which encodes an immune checkpoint in colorectal cancer (CRC), as a potential target for RNA editing. We performed transcriptome sequencing analysis and experimental validation in two Chinese CRC cohorts. PVR and ADAR expressions significantly increased in CRC tumors and showed positive correlations in both cohorts, coupled with upregulated PVR RNA editing in CRC tumors. Manipulation of ADAR expression by over-expression or knockdown substantially changed PVR expression and RNA editing in HTC116 CRC cells. Luciferase reporter and actinomycin D assays further revealed that RNA editing in PVR 3'-UTR could upregulate PVR RNA expression, probably by increasing the RNA stability. By increasing PVR expression, ADAR-mediate RNA editing might contribute to tumor- and immune-related gene functions and pathways in CRC. Moreover, a signature combining PVR RNA editing and expression showed promising predictive performance in CRC diagnosis in both Chinese CRC cohorts. Our findings thus highlight the importance of ADAR-mediated RNA editing in PVR up-regulation in CRC tumors and provide new insight into the application of PVR RNA editing as a novel diagnostic biomarker for CRC.",2023,12,14
Clotrimazole reverses macrophage M2 polarization by disrupting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.,"Macrophages switch among different activation phenotypes according to distinct environmental stimuli, varying from pro-inflammatory (M1) to alternative (also named resolutive; M2) activation forms. M1-and M2-activated macrophages represent the two extremes of the activation spectrum involving multiple species, which vary in terms of function and the cytokines secreted. The consensus is that molecular characterization of the distinct macrophage population and the signals driving their activation will help in explaining disease etiology and formulating therapies. For instance, myeloid cells residing in the tumor microenvironment are key players in tumor progression and usually display an M2-like phenotype, which help tumor cells to evade local inflammatory processes. Therefore, these specific cells have been proposed as targets for tumor therapies by changing their activation profile. Furthermore, M2 polarized macrophages are phagocytic cells promoting tissue repair and wound healing and are therefore potential targets to treat different diseases. We have already shown that clotrimazole (CTZ) decreases tumor cell viability and thus tumor growth. The mechanism by which CTZ exerts its effects remains to be determined, but this drug is an inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. In this study, we show that CTZ downregulated M2-activation markers in macrophages polarized to the M2 profile. This effect occurred without interfering with the expression of M1-polarized markers or pro-inflammatory cytokines and signaling. Moreover, CTZ suppressed NFkB pathway intermediates and disrupted PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. We concluded that CTZ reverses macrophage M2 polarization by disrupting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which results in the suppression of NFkB induction of M2 polarization. In addition, we find that CTZ represents a promising therapeutic tool as an antitumor agent.",2023,12,29
"Proficient sonophotocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants using Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposite immobilized on zeolite: Optimization, and artificial neural network modeling.","The health of all living organisms is greatly influenced by the quality of the water. Therefore, developing cost-effective, eco-friendly, and easily accessible methods is desperately needed to meet the high global demand for clean water. Recently, nanozyme-based dye degradation methods have been promising for the remediation of water pollution. In this work, peroxidase-mimic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposite was synthesized and characterized for its size, morphology, and crystalline structure. Colorimetric assay results showed that the peroxidase-like activity of the Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposite was considerably enhanced compared to the pure Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs and TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs. Besides excellent enzyme-mimic activity, the higher sonophotocatalytic dye degradation capability of the nanocomposite after immobilization on zeolite (Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>@Ze) was also demonstrated. Under optimal conditions (pH = 5.0, 25 °C), 0.1 g/L of catalyst was able to degrade 100 % of methylene blue (MB) with 600 μM in the presence of 30 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> within 12 min. GC/MS analysis and toxicity studies revealed less toxic metabolite production after treatment of MB with sonophotocatalytic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>@Ze. Modeling of MB degradation using artificial neural networks (ANN) with a 5:6:1 topology was successfully performed, and the results confirmed the fitness of theoretical and experimental outputs according to the calculated correlation coefficient values. The prepared nanocomposite could thus be used as a promising and highly effective catalyst for the removal of organic dyes from polluted water.",2023,12,22

A Direct Wavepath-based Element Localization Algorithm to Enable Flexible Ultrasound Array Imaging.,"An algorithm is developed for determining the element locations of a flexible ultrasonic array when applied to a surface of unknown geometry. The algorithm forms a dataset of traveltimes from the direct wavepaths (i.e. rays) between transmitters and receivers, which serves as the input to an optimization scheme that iterates on the array element locations until an objective function is minimized. Once, the relative array locations have been determined, they are used as an input to a phased array ultrasound imaging algorithm. In this study, the total focusing method with full matrix capture is used as a testbed code to demonstrate the benefits of the relative array element localization algorithm. The algorithm is verified by simulation and experimentation.",2023,12,20
"Bialorastins A-F, highly oxygenated and polycyclic andrastin-type meroterpenoids with proangiogenic activity from the deep-sea cold-seep-derived fungus Penicillium bialowiezense CS-283.","Six new highly oxygenated and polycyclic andrastin-type meroterpenoids, namely, bialorastins A-F (1-6), were discovered from the culture of Penicillium bialowiezense CS-283, a fungus isolated from the deep-sea cold seep squat lobster Shinkaia crosnieri. The planar structures and absolute configurations of these compounds were determined by detailed analysis of spectroscopic data, single crystal X-ray diffraction, and TDDFT-ECD calculations. Structurally, bialorastin A (1) represents a rare 17-nor-andrastin that possesses an unusual 2-oxaspiro[4.5]decane-1,4-dione moiety with a unique 6/6/6/6/5 polycyclic system, while bialorastin B (2) is also a 17-nor-andrastin featuring a gem-propane-1,2-dione moiety. Additionally, bialorastins C-E (3-5) possess a 6/6/6/6/5/5 fused hexacyclic skeleton, characterized by distinctive 3,23-acetal/lactone-bridged functionalities. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their proangiogenic activities in transgenic zebrafish. Compound 3 exhibited significant proangiogenic activity, which notably increased the number and length of intersegmental blood vessels in model zebrafish in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 20 and 40 μM. On a molecular scale, the tested compounds were modeled through molecular docking to have insight into the interactions with the possible target VEGFR2. Mechanistically, RT-qPCR results revealed that compound 3 could promote angiogenesis via activating VEGFR2 and subsequently activating the downstream PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways. These findings indicate that 3 could be a potential lead compound for developing angiogenesis agents.",2023,12,30
Weakly supervised image segmentation beyond tight bounding box annotations.,"Weakly supervised image segmentation approaches in the literature usually achieve high segmentation performance using tight bounding box supervision and decrease the performance greatly when supervised by loose bounding boxes. However, compared with loose bounding box, it is much more difficult to acquire tight bounding box due to its strict requirements on the precise locations of the four sides of the box. To resolve this issue, this study investigates whether it is possible to maintain good segmentation performance when loose bounding boxes are used as supervision. For this purpose, this work extends our previous parallel transformation based multiple instance learning (MIL) for tight bounding box supervision by integrating an MIL strategy based on polar transformation to assist image segmentation. The proposed polar transformation based MIL formulation works for both tight and loose bounding boxes, in which a positive bag is defined as pixels in a polar line of a bounding box with one endpoint located inside the object enclosed by the box and the other endpoint located at one of the four sides of the box. Moreover, a weighted smooth maximum approximation is introduced to incorporate the observation that pixels closer to the origin of the polar transformation are more likely to belong to the object in the box. The proposed approach was evaluated on two public datasets using dice coefficient when bounding boxes at different precision levels were considered in the experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for bounding boxes at all precision levels and is robust to mild and moderate errors in the loose bounding box annotations. The codes are available at https://github.com/wangjuan313/wsis-beyond-tightBB.",2023,12,29

"Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel discoidin domain receptor inhibitors for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma and pulmonary fibrosis.","Discoidin domain receptors (DDR) play crucial roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. When DDRs are overexpressed, it has been associated with various diseases such as cancers, fibrotic disorders, and inflammation. This study aimed to expand on previous research by using a structure-based drug design approach to develop a series of new indole-urea derivatives as potent inhibitors of DDR1. Through biochemical analyses, it was found that these compounds effectively inhibited DDR1/2, with compound 7s demonstrating the highest activity against A549 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.84 μM) while maintaining selectivity for other kinases. In vivo studies showed that compound 7s exhibited stronger antitumor activity compared to dasatinib, without causing significant weight loss at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Further investigation revealed that compound 7s hindered the migration of A549 cells by targeting the ERK, Akt1, and EMT pathways. Additionally, cellular experiments demonstrated that compound 7s suppressed the activation of fibroblasts induced by TGF-β1. In vivo experiments confirmed that compound 7s, at a dose of 30 mg/kg, effectively inhibited DDR1 activation, resulting in a reduction of lung injury and fibrosis induced by bleomycin. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of these novel DDR1 inhibitors as promising therapeutic candidates for the treatment of DDR-related diseases.",2023,12,30
Identification of diverse sesquiterpenoids with anti-fibrotic potential from Inula japonica Thunb.,"In the chemical investigation of Inula japonica, a total of 29 sesquiterpenoids (1-29) were obtained, including pseudoguaine-, xanthane-, eudesmane-, and 1,10-secoeudesmane-type compounds, as well as their dimers. Among them, six new dimeric sesquiterpenoids, bisinulains A-F (1-5, 7), characterized by a [4 + 2] biogenetic pathway between different sesquiterpenoid monomers were identified. Additionally, three new monomers named inulaterins A-C (13, 18 and 21) were discovered. The structures of these compounds were determined through analysis of spectroscopic data, X-ray crystallographic data, and ECD experiments. To assess their potential anti-inflammatory activities, the sesquiterpenoid dimers were tested for their ability to inhibit NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, the compounds that exhibited anti-inflammatory effects underwent evaluation for their anti-fibrotic potential using a TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition model in A549 cells. As a result, bisinulain B (2) was screened out to significantly inhibit the production of cytokines involved in pulmonary fibrosis such as NO, α-SMA, collagen I and fibronectin.",2023,12,31

The study involved a total of 92 Danish Landrace x Yorkshire sows (herd A) and 114 French Landrace × Yorkshire sows (herd B). In herd B, a total of 61 sows had their blood samples collected within 1 hr after the onset of farrowing to evaluate their blood glucose levels. The interval between the last meal and the onset of farrowing averaged 5.9 ± 4.5 and 5.4 ± 4.1 hr in herds A and B, respectively. Neither the duration of farrowing nor the occurrence of stillborn piglets in both herds was affected by the time gap between the last meal and the onset of farrowing. At the onset of farrowing, the average blood glucose level in sows was 77.1 ± 19.3 mg/dL, with a range of 27 to 115 mg/dL. There was a positive correlation observed between the blood glucose concentration and the colostrum yield of the sows (r=0.261, P=0.042). In conclusion, the time interval between the last meal and the onset of farrowing did not have any impact on the farrowing performance of sows. However, a higher concentration of blood glucose at the onset of farrowing was associated with an improvement in the colostrum yield of the sows.",2023,12,28
Structural and functional basis of VLDLR usage by Eastern equine encephalitis virus.,"The very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) comprises eight LDLR type A (LA) domains and supports entry of distantly related alphaviruses, including Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV). Here, by resolving multiple cryo-electron microscopy structures of EEEV-VLDLR complexes and performing mutagenesis and functional studies, we show that EEEV uses multiple sites (E1/E2 cleft and E2 A domain) to engage more than one LA domain simultaneously. However, no single LA domain is necessary or sufficient to support efficient EEEV infection. Whereas all EEEV strains show conservation of two VLDLR-binding sites, the EEEV PE-6 strain and a few other EEE complex members feature a single amino acid substitution that enables binding of LA domains to an additional site on the E2 B domain. These structural and functional analyses informed the design of a minimal VLDLR decoy receptor that neutralizes EEEV infection and protects mice from lethal challenge.",2023,12,28
"OXCT1 functions as a succinyltransferase, contributing to hepatocellular carcinoma via succinylating LACTB.","Metabolic reprogramming is an important feature of cancers that has been closely linked to post-translational protein modification (PTM). Lysine succinylation is a recently identified PTM involved in regulating protein functions, whereas its regulatory mechanism and possible roles in tumor progression remain unclear. Here, we show that OXCT1, an enzyme catalyzing ketone body oxidation, functions as a lysine succinyltransferase to contribute to tumor progression. Mechanistically, we find that OXCT1 functions as a succinyltransferase, with residue G424 essential for this activity. We also identified serine beta-lactamase-like protein (LACTB) as a main target of OXCT1-mediated succinylation. Extensive succinylation of LACTB K284 inhibits its proteolytic activity, resulting in increased mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration, ultimately leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In summary, this study establishes lysine succinyltransferase function of OXCT1 and highlights a link between HCC prognosis and LACTB K284 succinylation, suggesting a potentially valuable biomarker and therapeutic target for further development.",2023,12,28
Computed tomographic dimensions and densities of the normal eye in Jeju horses.,"This study aimed to describe the computed tomographic (CT) dimensions and the contrast attenuation of the eye in Jeju horses and Thoroughbreds. We evaluated the CT images of 10 Jeju horses and 6 Thoroughbreds without ocular abnormalities to assess the ocular dimensions and contrast attenuation. The following measurements showed significant differences between Jeju horses and Thoroughbreds (P<0.05): the diameters of the lens, globe, posterior segment, orbital fossa, and lateromedial distance of the anterior chamber; and the Hounsfield units of the vitreous body. This study describes the CT anatomical characteristics of Jeju horses and Thoroughbreds and the differences between the two breeds and provides useful information for understanding and evaluating of the eyes of Jeju horses through a CT scan.",2023,12,29
Body traits variation of a reef building polychaete across a latitudinal gradient.,"Body size is considered the most important trait in ecology, and as such, helps to understand the species-environment interactions. We explored the relationship between body traits and environmental variables along a gradient range using the polychaete Phragmatopoma caudata, with well-defined and diversified morphological structures. Measurements of five traits (body length, opercular crown, branchiae, tentacles and building organ sizes) were taken at nine sites along the Southwestern Atlantic coast and their relationships to temperature, salinity, tidal range, waves height, and dissolved oxygen were assessed. Our results demonstrate that traits were influenced by the environmental gradient and temperature was the main factor that drives this variation in body traits, while the other variables showed a minor influence on this. The approach showed patterns of variation of body traits in a macroscale context, increasing the understanding of its relationships with environmental variables and eventual shifts in the distribution in the future climate scenarios.",2023,12,30
"Design, synthesis, and anti-cancer evaluation of C-14 arylcarbamate derivatives of andrographolide.","In this study, we explored a concise and mild synthetic route to produce novel C-14 arylcarbamate derivatives of andrographolide, a known anti-inflammatory and anticancer natural product. Upon assessing their anti-cancer efficacy against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, some derivatives showed stronger cytotoxicity against PANC-1 cells than andrographolide. In addition, we demonstrated one derivative, compound 3m, effectively reduced the expression of oncogenic p53 mutant proteins (p53<sup>R273H</sup> and p53<sup>R248W</sup>), proliferation, and migration in PDAC lines, PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2. Accordingly, the novel derivative holds promise as an anti-cancer agent against pancreatic cancer. In summary, our study broadens the derivative library of andrographolide and develops an arylcarbamate derivative of andrographolide with promising anticancer activity against PDAC.",2023,12,28

Feedback linearization control for uncertain nonlinear systems via generative adversarial networks.,"This article presents a novel approach to leverage generative adversarial networks(GANs) techniques to learn a feedback linearization controller(FLC) for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. By estimating uncertainty through the adversarial process, where ground truth samples are exclusively obtained from a predefined integral model, the feedback linearization controller, learned through a minimax two-player optimization framework, enhances the reference tracking performance of the input-output uncertain nonlinear system. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantee of convergence and stability, demonstrating the safe recovery of robust FLC. We also address the common challenge of mode collapse in GANs training through the strict convexity of our synthesized generator structure and an enhanced adversarial loss. Comprehensive simulations and practical experiments are conducted to underscore the superiority and efficacy of our proposed approach.",2023,12,29
Bioinorganic chemistry of shepherin II complexes helps to fight Candida albicans?,"The fungal cell wall and cell membrane are an important target for antifungal therapies, and a needle-like cell wall or membrane disruption may be an entirely novel antifungal mode of action. In this work, we show how the coordination of Zn(II) triggers the antifungal properties of shepherin II, a glycine- and histidine-rich antimicrobial peptide from the root of Capsella bursa-pastoris. We analyze Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes of this peptide using experimental and theoretical methods, such as: mass spectrometry, potentiometry, UV-Vis and CD spectroscopies, AFM imaging, biological activity tests and DFT calculations in order to understand the correlation between their metal binding mode, structure, morphology and biological activity. We observe that Zn(II) coordinates to Shep II and causes a structural change, resulting in fibril formation, what has a pronounced biological consequence - a strong anticandidal activity. This phenomenon was observed neither for the peptide itself, nor for its copper(II) complex. The Zn(II) - shepherin II complex can be considered as a starting point for further anticandidal drug discovery, which is extremely important in the era of increasing antifungal drug resistance.",2023,12,29
Aggregation-induced emission-active iridium (III)-based mitochondria-targeting nanoparticle for two-photon imaging-guided photodynamic therapy.,"The efficacy of imaging-guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) is compromised by the attenuation of fluorescence and decline in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation efficiency in the physiological environment of conventional photosensitizers, limited near-infrared (NIR) absorption, and high systemic cytotoxicity. This paper presents the synthesis of two cyclometalated Ir (III) complexes (Ir-thpy and Ir-ppy) by using a triphenylamine derivative (DPTPA) as the primary ligand and their encapsulation into an amphiphilic phospholipid to form nanoparticles (NPs). These complexes exhibit aggregation-induced emission features and remarkably enhanced ROS generation compared to Chlorin e6 (Ce6). Moreover, Ir-thpy NPs possess the unique ability to selectively target mitochondria, leading to depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and ultimately triggering apoptosis. Notably, Ir-thpy NPs exhibit exceptional photocytotoxicity even towards cisplatin-resistant A549/DDP tumor cells. In vivo two-photon imaging verified the robust tumor-targeting efficacy of Ir-thpy NPs. The in vivo results unequivocally demonstrate that Ir-thpy NPs exhibit excellent tumor ablation along with remarkable biocompatibility. This study presents a promising approach for the development of multifunctional Ir-NPs for two-photon imaging-guided PDT and provides novel insights for potential clinical applications in oncology.",2023,12,30
Preparation of gastrodin modified P(VDF-TrFE)-Eudragit L100-AuNPs nanofiber membranes with piezoelectric property.,"In recent years, electroactive nerve conduits made from a blend of P(VDF-TrFE) (poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene)) with other materials have shown significant progress. However, research combining P(VDF-TrFE) conduits with drug delivery systems remains sparse. In this study, we developed a novel gastrodin-loaded P(VDF-TrFE)-Eudragit L100-gold nanoparticles (Gas@PT-EL100-AuNPs) nanofiber membrane. Fabricated through electrospinning technique, this composite membrane aimed to investigate the impacts of gastrodin and AuNPs on its properties. Experimental results indicated that the incorporation of gold nanoparticles significantly reduced the fiber diameter of the membrane and enhanced the overall performance by improving hydrophilicity and piezoelectric properties. Specifically, the addition of AuNPs substantially enhanced the piezoelectric performance of the nanofiber membrane. Furthermore, the inclusion of gastrodin not only improved the membrane's hydrophilicity but also enabled effective release of the neuroprotective drug. These findings suggest that the Gas@PT-EL100-AuNPs nanofiber membrane is a novel biomaterial with potential applications in the repair and treatment of nerve injuries.",2023,12,29
Applications of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) based nanostructured materials: A review.,"While polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has enjoyed widespread use, a large volume of plastic waste has also been produced as a result, which is detrimental to the environment. Traditional treatment of plastic waste, such as landfilling and incinerating waste, causes environmental pollution and poses risks to public health. Recycling PET waste into useful chemicals or upcycling the waste into high value-added materials can be remedies. This review first provides a brief introduction of the synthesis, structure, properties, and applications of virgin PET. Then the conversion process of waste PET into high value-added materials for different applications are introduced. The conversion mechanisms (including degradation, recycling and upcycling) are detailed. The advanced applications of these upgraded materials in energy storage devices (supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and microbial fuel cells), and for water treatment (to remove dyes, heavy metals, and antibiotics), environmental remediation (for air filtration, CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption, and oil removal) and catalysis (to produce H<sub>2</sub>, photoreduce CO<sub>2</sub>, and remove toxic chemicals) are discussed at length. In general, this review details the exploration of advanced technologies for the transformation of waste PET into nanostructured materials for various applications, and provides insights into the role of high value-added waste products in sustainability and economic development.",2023,12,31
Multifunctioning of carboxylic-cellulose nanocrystals on the reinforcement of compressive strength and conductivity for acrylic-based hydrogel.,"Simultaneously having competitive compressive properties, fatigue-resistant stability, excellent conductivity and sensitivity has still remained a challenge for acrylic-based conductive hydrogels, which is critical in their use in the sensor areas where pressure is performed. In this work, an integrated strategy was proposed for preparing a conductive hydrogel based on acrylic acid (AA) and sodium alginate (SA) by addition of carboxylic-cellulose nanocrystals (CNC-COOH) followed by metal ion interaction to reinforce its compressive strength and conductivity simultaneously. The CNC-COOH played a multifunctional role in the hydrogel by well-dispersing SA and AA in the hydrogel precursor solution for forming a uniform semi-interpenetrating network, providing more hydrogen bonds with SA and AA, more -COOH for metal ion interactions to form uniform multi-network, and also offering high modulus to the final hydrogel. Accordingly, the as-prepared hydrogels showed simultaneous excellent compressive strength (up to 3.02 MPa at a strain of 70 %) and electrical conductivity (6.25 S m<sup>-1</sup>), good compressive fatigue-resistant (93.2 % strength retention after 1000 compressive cycles under 50 % strain) and high sensitivity (gauge factor up to 14.75). The hydrogel strain sensor designed in this work is capable of detecting human body movement of pressing, stretching and bending with highly sensitive conductive signals, which endows it great potential for multi-scenario strain sensing applications.",2023,12,12
Automatic motion artefact detection in brain T1-weighted magnetic resonance images from a clinical data warehouse using synthetic data.,"Containing the medical data of millions of patients, clinical data warehouses (CDWs) represent a great opportunity to develop computational tools. Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) are particularly sensitive to patient movements during image acquisition, which will result in artefacts (blurring, ghosting and ringing) in the reconstructed image. As a result, a significant number of MRIs in CDWs are corrupted by these artefacts and may be unusable. Since their manual detection is impossible due to the large number of scans, it is necessary to develop tools to automatically exclude (or at least identify) images with motion in order to fully exploit CDWs. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning method from research to clinical data for the automatic detection of motion in 3D T1-weighted brain MRI. The method consists of two steps: a pre-training on research data using synthetic motion, followed by a fine-tuning step to generalise our pre-trained model to clinical data, relying on the labelling of 4045 images. The objectives were both (1) to be able to exclude images with severe motion, (2) to detect mild motion artefacts. Our approach achieved excellent accuracy for the first objective with a balanced accuracy nearly similar to that of the annotators (balanced accuracy>80 %). However, for the second objective, the performance was weaker and substantially lower than that of human raters. Overall, our framework will be useful to take advantage of CDWs in medical imaging and highlight the importance of a clinical validation of models trained on research data.",2023,12,23
Retrieving complete plastid genomes of endangered Guibourtia timber using hybridization capture for forensic identification and phylogenetic analysis.,"The high economic value and increased demand for timber have led to illegal logging and overexploitation, threatening wild populations. In this context, there is an urgent need to develop effective and accurate forensic tools for identifying endangered Guibourtia timber species to protect forest ecosystem resources and regulate their trade. In this study, a hybridization capture method was developed and applied to explore the feasibility of retrieving complete plastid genomes from Guibourtia sapwood and heartwood specimens stored in a xylarium (wood collection). We then carried out forensic identification and phylogenetic analyses of Guibourtia within the subfamily Detarioideae. This study is the first to successfully retrieve high-quality plastid genomes from xylarium specimens, with 76.95-99.97% coverage. The enrichment efficiency, sequence depth, and coverage of plastid genomes from sapwood were 16.73 times, 70.47 times and 1.14 times higher, respectively, than those from heartwood. Although the DNA capture efficiency of heartwood was lower than that of sapwood, the hybridization capture method used in this study is still suitable for heartwood DNA analysis. Based on the complete plastid genome, we identified six endangered or commonly traded Guibourtia woods at the species level. This technique also has the potential for geographical traceability, especially for Guibourtia demeusei and Guibourtia ehie. Meanwhile, Bayesian phylogenetic analysis suggested that these six Guibourtia species diverged from closely related species within the subfamily Detarioideae ca. 18 Ma during the Miocene. The DNA reference database established based on the xylarium specimens provides admissible evidence for diversity conservation and evolutionary analyses of endangered Guibourtia species.",2023,12,28
Composite starch films as green adsorbents for removing benzo[a]pyrene from smoked sausages.,"Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), which is emitted during the processing of smoked sausages, accumulates in sausages and poses a serious threat to human health. This study focused on the removal of BaP from sausages and accompanying particulate matter (PM) during the smoking of sausages by films formed by combining corn starch (CS) with K-carrageenan (KC)/sodium alginate (SA). Initially, the effects of different additions of KC and SA on the rheological analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and film-forming properties of the composite films were investigated. The BaP reduction capacities of CS-KC and CS-SA composite films in sausage were 41.1%-47.0% and 54.2%-56.5%, respectively, because the three-dimensional mesh structure of the composite films provided a large number of adsorption sites. Finally, kinetic studies demonstrated that BaP control in composite films is mainly achieved by intraparticle diffusion. Therefore, due to its excellent recyclability and biodegradability, composite starch film has a promising application in smoked meat products.",2023,12,30
Prognostic factors and clinical nomogram for in-hospital mortality in traumatic brain injury.,Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and functional disability in the general population.

ANNprob-ACPs: A novel anticancer peptide identifier based on probabilistic feature fusion approach.,"Anticancer Peptides (ACPs) offer significant potential as cancer treatment drugs in this modern era. Quickly identifying active compounds from protein sequences is crucial for healthcare and cancer treatment. In this paper ANNprob-ACPs, a novel and effective model for detecting ACPs has been implemented based on nine feature encoding techniques, including AAC, CC, W2V, DPC, PAAC, QSO, CTDC, CTDT, and CKSAAGP. After analyzing the performance of several machine learning models, the six best models were selected based on their overall performances in every evaluation metric. The probability scores of each model were subsequently aggregated and used as input of our meta- model, called ANNprob-ACPs. Our model outperformed all others and its potential to lead to phenomenal identification of ACPs. The results of this study showed notable improvement in 10-fold cross-validation and independent test, with accuracy of 93.72% and 90.62%, respectively. Our proposed model, ANNprob-ACPs outperformed existing approaches in terms of accuracy and effectiveness in discovering ACPs. By using SHAP, this study obtained the physicochemical properties of QSO, and compositional properties of DPC, AAC, and PAAC are more impactful for our model's performances, which have a major impact on a drug's interactions and future discoveries. Consequently, this model is crucial for the future and has a high probability of detecting ACPs more frequently. We developed a web server of ANNprob-ACPs, which is accessible at ANNprob-ACPs webserver.",2023,12,31
Titanium-based substrate modified with nanoenzyme for accelerating the repair of bone defect.,"Titanium (Ti) and titanium alloy are the most common metal materials in clinical orthopedic surgery. However, in the initial stage of surgery and implantation, the production of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) can induce oxidative stress (OS) microenvironment. OS will further inhibit the growth of new bone, resulting in surgical failure. In this study, based on the fact that nanoscale manganese dioxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>) can show H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-like enzyme activity, a MnO<sub>2</sub> nanocoating was prepared on mciro-nano structured surface of Ti substrate via a two-step method of alkaline thermal and hydrothermal treatment. The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that the nano-MnO<sub>2</sub> coating was successfully fabricated on the surface of Ti substrate. The results of measurement of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, dissolved O<sub>2</sub> and intracellular ROS in vitro showed that the treated Ti substrate could efficiently eliminate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and reduce ROS. Furthermore, the modified Ti substrate could promote the early adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, which was demonstrated by experimental results of cell morphology, cell viability, alkaline phosphatase, collagen, and mineralization deposition. The results of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of MSCs adhered the modified Ti substrate showed that the expression of genes related to osteogenic differentiation significantly increased. More importantly, the modified Ti implant could eliminate ROS at the injury site, reduce OS and promote the regeneration of bone tissue, which was demonstrated via hematoxylin/eosin, Masson's trichrome and immunohistochemical staining. In conclusion, the modified Ti implant presented here had the effect of reducing OS and promoting osseointegration. Relevant research ideas and results provide new methods for the research and development of functional implants, which have potential application value in the field of orthopedics.",2023,12,29

Er:YAG laser settings for debonding zirconia restorations: An in vitro study.,"This in vitro study aimed to determine the optimal frequency and energy settings for debonding zirconia restorations using an erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) laser. A total of 200 zirconia specimens (5 mm × 5 mm × 1.5 mm) were fabricated from two types of materials: (1) 3 mol% yttria oxide stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline (3Y-TZP) and (2) 5 mol% yttria oxide stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline (5Y-TZP). The zirconia specimens were bonded to dentin using resin cement (RelyX Ultimate, 3 M) and divided into 20 groups based on their laser treatments (n = 5). Er:YAG laser treatment was applied at various frequencies (10 Hz and 20 Hz) and energies (80 mJ, 100 mJ, 120 mJ, 140 mJ, 160 mJ, 180 mJ, 200 mJ, 220 mJ, 240 mJ, and 260 mJ). The time required to debond the specimens and the temperature changes that dentin underwent during the laser treatment were recorded. The surface morphologies of the debonded dentin and zirconia specimens were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Additional zirconia specimens were fabricated for 4-point flexural strength testing and surface roughness measurements. Statistical analyses were conducted using three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK)-q tests (α = 0.05). The debonding time of each specimen varied between 4.8 and 160.4 s, with an average value of 59.2 s. The dentin temperature change for each specimen ranged from 2.3 to 3.6 °C, with an average value of 2.7 °C. The debonding time was significantly influenced by the zirconia material type and laser energy, but it was not affected by the laser frequency. Among the specimens, those made of 3Y-TZP needed significantly more time for debonding than 5Y-TZP. The optimal energies were 220 mJ for 3Y-TZP and 200 mJ for 5Y-TZP. The laser frequency, laser energy, and type of zirconia material had no effect on the dentin temperature change. Additionally, no surface alternations were observed on the dentin or zirconia materials after laser treatment. The surface roughness and flexural strength of the zirconia materials remained unchanged after laser treatment. In summary, Er:YAG laser treatment effectively and safely removes zirconia restorations without impacting their mechanical properties, with a safe temperature change of less than 5.6 °C. The optimum frequency and energy settings for debonding 3Y-TZP and 5Y-TZP restorations were found to be 10/20 Hz and 220 mJ and 10/20 Hz and 200 mJ, respectively.",2023,12,20

Passport to Freedom: A Trauma-Informed Mindfulness Program for Previously Incarcerated Women.,"Poly-victimization is often reported by formerly incarcerated women and leads to physical and mental health problems that interfere with daily functioning, sustained employment, and housing stability. Although reentry programs exist, few focus on the physical and emotional impact of multiple traumas. Passport to Freedom (P2F), a woman-centered, trauma-informed reentry program, was developed to support formerly incarcerated women. The pilot intervention, performed in 2017, focused on the connections between trauma and health, coping with symptoms, and managing one's own health. To examine the effectiveness and feasibility of the intervention, we performed the current mixed methods study with two phases: (1) focus groups, and (2) sessions combining mindfulness and health promotion activities with follow-up evaluations. Participants (<i>N</i> = 24) showed decreased symptoms of depression and concerns of everyday stressors after the intervention. Of participants, 84% (<i>n</i> = 16) reported practicing mindfulness and 63% (<i>n</i> = 8) stated that mindfulness exercises helped with daily stress management. The P2F program offers a promising approach to support formerly incarcerated women with health self-management.

Sampled-based adaptive event-triggered resilient control for multiagent systems with hybrid cyber-attacks.,"The multiagent systems have shared broad application in many practical systems including unmanned aircraft clusters, intelligent robots, and intelligent transportation. However, many unexpected cyber-attacks may disturb or disrupt the normal communication of the agents, thus reducing the interacting efficiency of multiagent systems. Ever since the cyber-attacks have been proposed, the resilient control problem for multiagent systems has been intensively explored in light of the communication network growth. However, most of the consequences only focused on denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or deception attacks independently. Distinguished from the existing resilient control mechanisms, the current investigation represents the first attempt at designing an adaptive resilient controller for multiagent systems according to the sampled-based adaptive event-triggered manner, where denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and deception attacks are both considered. First, the hybrid cyber-attacks model and its impact on the closed-loop system are addressed. And then, an adaptive event-triggered strategy is proposed to reduce network resource consumption and ease the communication burden, where the designed adaptive law can automatically adjust the triggering threshold. Finally, the consensus state of multiagent systems is capable of achieving via a series of reasonable control rules formulated through Lyapunov functional approach despite suffering hybrid cyber-attacks. And a simulation example is given to substantiate the feasibility of the proposed method.",2023,12,29
Site-scale groundwater pollution risk assessment using surrogate models and statistical analysis.,"Petroleum pollution in soil and groundwater has emerged as a significant environmental concern worldwide. As a sustainable and cost-effective in-situ remediation technique, Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) exhibits significant promise in addressing sites contaminated by petrochemicals. This study specifically targets a typical petrochemical-contaminated site in northern China and employs GMS software to establish a comprehensive physical model. The model relies on time-series monitoring data of phenol concentrations spanning from 2018 to 2020, effectively simulating both the leakage and natural attenuation of phenol. Within this study, the adsorption coefficient and maximum adsorption capacity emerge as the foremost influential factors shaping the outcomes of the model. Given the inherent heterogeneity of the site and the variability of hydrochemical conditions, parameters such as dispersion, porosity, and adsorption coefficient exhibit significant uncertainties. Consequently, relying on traditional deterministic models to predict the feasibility of MNA technology is not reliable. Therefore, this study employs machine learning (ML) methods to construct stochastic parameter models based on physical processes. The Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithm, after trained, demonstrates strong alignment with numerical model output, exhibiting an average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) >0.96. Using a stochastic approach, RFR iteratively computes phenol concentration across 6000 sets of parameters. Applying probability statistics, the model shows a notable reduction in the likelihood of phenol concentrations exceeding a threshold, dropping from 64.0% to 15.7% before and after natural attenuation. In parameter uncertainty, the stochastic model emphasizes natural attenuation's efficacy in mitigating phenol pollution risk (porosity being the most influential factor). This case study proposed a novel method to quickly assess the pollution risks at petrochemical sites under the influence of the uncertainty of pollutant transport and reaction parameters. The results can provide a reference for the pollution risk assessment at petrochemical sites, especially in sites with high stratigraphic heterogeneity or insufficient transport parameter data.",2023,12,26
Rethinking automatic segmentation of gross target volume from a decoupling perspective.,"Accurate and reliable segmentation of Gross Target Volume (GTV) is critical in cancer Radiation Therapy (RT) planning, but manual delineation is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variations. Recently, deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in medical image segmentation. However, due to the low image contrast and extreme pixel imbalance between GTV and adjacent tissues, most existing methods usually obtained limited performance on automatic GTV segmentation. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Cascade Framework (HCF) from a decoupling perspective, which decomposes the GTV segmentation into independent recognition and segmentation subtasks. The former aims to screen out the abnormal slices containing GTV, while the latter performs pixel-wise segmentation of these slices. With the decoupled two-stage framework, we can efficiently filter normal slices to reduce false positives. To further improve the segmentation performance, we design a multi-level Spatial Alignment Network (SANet) based on the feature pyramid structure, which introduces a spatial alignment module into the decoder to compensate for the information loss caused by downsampling. Moreover, we propose a Combined Regularization (CR) loss and Balance-Sampling Strategy (BSS) to alleviate the pixel imbalance problem and improve network convergence. Extensive experiments on two public datasets of StructSeg2019 challenge demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially with significant advantages in reducing false positives and accurately segmenting small objects.

We report a case of acute sensorimotor polyneuropathy in a patient with Tangier disease (TD) who was treated with miglustat which is a glycosphingolipid synthesis inhibitor. TD is a very rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ABCA1 gene which encodes the cholesterol efflux regulatory protein. It leads to accumulation of cholesterol esters within various tissues and affects lipid metabolism by deficiency of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the blood. Due to the accumulation of cholesterol esters in Schwann cells, it could provoke polyneuropathy in TD. Our case presented to our clinic with quadriparesis and after treated with miglustat therapy his weakness regressed.",2023,12,02
Adjustable strength and toughness of dual cross-linked nanocellulose films via spherical cellulose as soft-phase.,"Nanocellulose films possess numerous merits ascribing to their inherent biocompatibility, non-toxic and biodegradability properties. The potential for practical applications would be improved if their mechanical strength and toughness requirements could be met simultaneously. Herein, dual cross-linked nanocellulose (DC) film was fabricated by the treatments of chemical and physical cross-linking, which was mechanically superior to pure nanocellulose (CNF) films. To further increase the toughness of DC films, spherical cellulose (Sph) was incorporated into DC film (DC-Sph film), and analyzed under different humidity conditions (RH) (from 10 % to 90 %). The changes of functional groups of CNF, DC and DC-Sph films were detected by FTIR and XPS spectrum. The epichlorohydrin and Sph content were optimized, followed by the investigation of RH on the toughness of films. The highest tensile strength (146.6 ± 4.6 MPa) was obtained in DC film at 50 % RH, while the DC-Sph film showed the largest toughness (40.3 ± 3.7 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>) at 70 % RH. Furthermore, the possible toughening mechanism of DC-Sph film was also discussed.",2023,12,17
Axial assembly of AuNR for tumor theranostics via Zn<sup>2+</sup>-GSH chelation induced degradation of AuNR@ZIF-8 heterostructures.,"Tumor microenvironment responsive photothermal ablation is a noninvasive and accurately targeted approach for cancer therapy. Herein, an intracellular directional assembly strategy for enhanced photothermal therapy (PTT) was realized by using ZIF-8 encapsulated Au nanorod (AuNR) heterostructure as the precursor of photothermal convertible material. The ZIF-8 shell selectively degraded in tumor cells upon the chelation between GSH and Zn<sup>2+</sup>, while the as-formed Zn(SG) connected the released AuNR in end-to-end fashion. The coating of ZIF-8 shell significantly improves the stability and targeting of AuNR, and the released Zn<sup>2+</sup> shielded the GSH binding site on the lateral side of AuNR, increased the plasmonic coupling efficiency of AuNR assembly geometer. This design enabled atomic-economical, efficient and low-side effect targeted photothermal therapy through the effective integration of heterostructures.",2023,12,12
Novel sulfate solid supported binary Ru-Ir oxides for superior electrocatalytic activity towards OER and CER.,"Electrolysis for producing hydrogen powered by renewable electricity can be dramatically expanded by adapting different electrolytes (brine, seawater or pure water), which means the anode materials must stand up to complex electrolyte conditions. Here, a novel catalyst/support hybrid of binary Ru<sub>3.5</sub>Ir<sub>1</sub>O<sub>x</sub> supported by barium strontium sulfate (BaSrSO<sub>4</sub>) was synthesized (RuIrO<sub>x</sub>/BSS) by exchanging the anion ligands of support. The as-synthesized RuIrO<sub>x</sub>/BSS exhibits compelling oxygen evolution (OER) and chlorine evolution (CER) performances, which affords to 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> with only overpotential of 244 mV and 38 mV, respectively. The performed X-ray adsorption spectra clearly indicate the presence of an interface charge transfer effect, which results in the assignment of more electrons to the d orbitals of the Ru and Ir sites. The theoretical calculations demonstrated that the electronic structures of the catalytic active sites were modulated to give a lower overpotential, confirming the intrinsically high OER and CER catalytic activity.",2023,12,30
Contribution of micropores in porous zirconia spheres to high optical transparency of dental resin composites.,"Transparency to UV-Vis light and radiopacity of dental resin composites containing zirconia (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) fillers were investigated. The transparency of the resin composite containing porous ZrO<sub>2</sub> spheres was much higher than that containing irregularly shaped ZrO<sub>2</sub> particles. Calcination of the porous ZrO<sub>2</sub> spheres at high temperatures led to dramatically reduced specific surface areas and pore volumes. The transparency of the resin composite containing the calcined porous ZrO<sub>2</sub> spheres drastically decreased as the calcination temperature increased. Then, the enhanced UV-Vis transmittance of the resin composite containing porous ZrO<sub>2</sub> spheres is attributed to the concentration and physical characteristics of the pores. The radiopacity of the resin composites containing porous ZrO<sub>2</sub> spheres increased slightly with increasing calcination temperature. This study revealed that the internal structure of the ZrO<sub>2</sub> fillers mainly influenced in the UV-Vis light transmittance of the resin composites.",2023,12,29

A novel amidine-based fluorescent probe TPE-4<sup>+</sup> for rapid detection of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate.,"An accurate, fast, and simple surfactant detection method is of great significance for monitoring surfactants pollution. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is one of the most commonly used anionic surfactants and has been listed as an important monitoring pollutant for surfactant residues. Herein, a novel fluorescent probe named TPE-4<sup>+</sup> with four amidines as the recognition functional group and tetraphenylethene as the fluorophore was fabricated. Due to the special intramolecular environment, the probe showed selectively identification towards SDS which made an aggregation induced fluorescence enhencement. Under the optimum conditions, the fluorescence enhencement of TPE-4<sup>+</sup> is linearly related to the concentration of SDS in the range of 5.0-60.0 μM with limit of detection (LOD) of 0.010 μM and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.034 μM. Relative to the reported methods, the probe in our work showed better selectivity and sensitivity. The proposed method was successfully applied for the SDS determination of disinfecting bowls.",2023,12,28
An improved repetitive controller with fractional time-delay for discrete-time linear systems: Synthesis and comparison study.,"This paper develops a discrete-time repetitive control (RC) system with a fractional-delay internal model. Unlike the conventional RC, the time delay for constructing the internal model is not necessarily an integer, implying that the time delay is allowed to be fractional. In this work, a fractional delay-based repetitive control system is presented. Firstly, the fractional time delay is calculated based on the information of the reference or disturbance along with the associated sampling period. Secondly, the fractional time delay is divided into two parts, i.e., the large integer and small fractional delays. Finally, the fractional part is realized by a stable and causal infinite impulse response (IIR) filter, whose coefficients are calculated using the Thiran formula. The controller structure and stability analysis are developed for three different RCs, namely a fractional-delay general RC (FD-GRC), a fractional delay-odd harmonics RC (FD-OHRC), and a fractional delay-(6l±1) RC (FD-(6l±1)RC). Experiments and comparison studies of the integer delay-based RCs are conducted to verify the effectiveness and improved tracking accuracy of the proposed method.",2023,12,27

Unraveling the contributing factors of stale odor in Longjing tea through a sensomics approach.,"Longjing tea is renowned for its fresh aroma and high value. However, during storage, the emergence of an off-flavor known as ""stale odor"" can significantly impact the flavor quality and economic benefits of Longjing tea. Yet, the specific volatiles responsible for this stale odor in Longjing tea remain unknown. In this study, Longjing tea samples with varying degrees of stale odor intensity were analyzed using simultaneous distillation extraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SDE-GC-MS). Through odor activity value (OAV) and fractional omission testing, hexanoic acid and trans-2-nonenal were identified as the primary contributors to the stale odor. Moreover, the concentration of hexanoic acid was found to be valuable in predicting the intensity of the stale odor in Longjing tea. The oxidative degradation of linoleic acid was proved as the generation pathway of stale odor in Longjing tea. These findings provide essential theoretical principles for Longjing tea production and preservation.",2023,12,30

"Physics-guided neural network for predicting asphalt mixture rutting with balanced accuracy, stability and rationality.","The prediction of rutting performance of asphalt materials poses a significant challenge due to the intricate relationships between the rutting performance and its influencing factors. Machine learning models have gained popularity to address this challenge by offering sophisticated model structures and algorithms. However, existing models often prioritize model accuracy over stability and rationality. The increasingly complicated model structure may lead to an imbalance between the data and the model, resulting in issues such as overfitting and reduced model applicability and interpretability. In this context, this study proposes a novel modeling framework to predict the rutting performance of asphalt mixture by utilizing autoencoder for feature selection and feedforward neural network for rut depth prediction. Notably, physics information of the selected variables is implemented into the neural network to achieve the appropriate balance of model accuracy, stability, and rationality. The results demonstrate that while maintaining high model accuracy, the implementation of physics information significantly enhances the model's stability and rationality. This framework holds great potential for accurate and reliable predictions of pavement distress by leveraging the complementary strengths of data-driven machine learning and physics-based domain knowledge.",2023,12,27
Effect of aggregation configuration of molecular fluorophore CZA on photoluminescence properties of carbon dots.,"The effect of aggregation configuration of molecular fluorophore citrazinic acid (CZA) on the photoluminescence (PL) properties of carbon dots (CDs) has been investigated using first-principles method. The structural stability of all aggregates has been analyzed, and the results show that the most stable structures are J-type CZA aggregates with head-to-tail configurations and the CZA/CD aggregates are bonded by replacing H atoms on the CD edges with de-OH from the pyridine ring of CZA. The luminescent properties of CZA/CD aggregates are mainly affected by the binding modes and binding sites. When the sites belong to electron-donating groups, electron-withdrawing groups or sp<sup>2</sup> domain, the PL spectra of CDs are shifted and the luminescent intensities are significantly enhanced. The results suggest that covalently bonded CZA/CD aggregates are responsible for the high fluorescence quantum yield of CD. Moreover, the distance between the centers of the two pyridine rings in H-type CZA dimers less than 3.5 Å is prone to π-π stacking, leading to fluorescence quenching of aggregates. The present work is helpful in understanding the effect of molecular fluorophores on the PL properties of CDs and provides theoretical guidance for the controllable synthesis of CDs.",2023,12,21
Azide-modified corrole phosphorus complexes for endoplasmic reticulum-targeted fluorescence bioimaging and effective cancer photodynamic therapy.,"Study on corrole photosensitizers (PSs) for photodynamic therapy (PDT) has made remarkable progress. Targeted delivery of PSs is of great significance for enhancing therapeutic efficiency, decreasing the dosage, and reducing systemic toxicity during PDT. The development of PSs that can be specifically delivered to the subcellular organelle is still an attractive and challenging work. Herein, we synthesize a series of azide-modified corrole phosphorus and gallium complex PSs, in which phosphorus corrole 2-P could not only precisely target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) up to 0.92 but also possesses the highest singlet oxygen quantum yields (Φ<sub>Δ</sub> = 0.75). This renders it remarkable PDT activity at a very low dosage (IC<sub>50</sub> = 23 nM) towards HepG2 tumor cell line while ablating solid tumors in vivo with excellent biosecurity. Furthermore, 2-P exhibits intense red fluorescence (Φ<sub>F</sub> = 0.25), outstanding photostability, and a large Stokes shift (190 nm), making it a promising fluorescent probe for ER. This study provides a clinically potential photosensitizer for cancer photodynamic therapy and a promising ER fluorescent probe for bioimaging.",2023,12,29
Finite-time prescribed performance tracking control of seeker stabilized platform in the discrete-time domain.,"Current prescribed performance control (PPC) focuses on continuous-time systems, while this article proposes a novel discrete-time version of PPC for finite-time tracking of seeker stabilized platform in the discrete-time domain. Firstly, the newly developed performance functions are employed to impose finite-time prescribed performance on tracking errors. After that, a type of stabilization functions with respect to transformed errors are constructed for back-stepping controllers designing. On this basis, transformed errors are indirectly stabilized, and thus the pursued prescribed transient and steady-state behaviors are ensured for tracking errors via Lyapunov synthesis. Different from existing sliding-mode-control based discrete-time PPC, the addressed approach eliminates the sliding-mode structure and hence avoids high frequency chattering caused by such framework. Finally, compared simulations validate the superiority over existing methods.",2023,12,04
Live-cell imaging of endogenous CSB-mScarletI as a sensitive marker for DNA-damage-induced transcription stress.,"Transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) is crucial for cellular function, but DNA damage severely impedes this process. Thus far, transcription-blocking DNA lesions (TBLs) and their repair have been difficult to quantify in living cells. To overcome this, we generated, using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing, mScarletI-tagged Cockayne syndrome group B protein (CSB) and UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA) knockin cells. These cells allowed us to study the binding dynamics of CSB and UVSSA to lesion-stalled RNA Pol II using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We show that especially CSB mobility is a sensitive transcription stress marker at physiologically relevant DNA damage levels. Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER)-mediated repair can be assessed by studying CSB immobilization over time. Additionally, flow cytometry reveals the regulation of CSB protein levels by CRL4<sup>CSA</sup>-mediated ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation by USP7. This approach allows the sensitive detection of TBLs and their repair and the study of TC-NER complex assembly and stability in living cells.",2023,12,27
Non-invasive evaluation of vascular permeability in formalin-induced orofacial pain model using infrared thermography.,"Enhanced vascular permeability at the site of injury is a prominent feature in acute inflammatory pain models, commonly assessed through the Evans Blue test. However, this invasive test requires euthanasia, thereby precluding further investigations on the same animal. Due to these limitations, the integration of non-invasive tools such as IRT has been sought. Here, we aimed to evaluate the use of thermography in a common orofacial pain model that employs formalin as a chemical irritant to induce local orofacial inflammation. Male Hannover rats (290-300 g, N = 43) were used. In the first approach, radiometric images were taken before and after formalin administration, assessing temperature changes and extravasated Evans Blue. The second approach included capturing pre- and post-formalin test radiometric images, followed by cytokine measurements in excised vibrissae tissue. Rats were anesthetized for vibrissae tissue collection, allowing correlations between thermographic patterns, nocifensive behavior duration, and cytokine levels in this area. Our findings revealed a positive correlation between local temperature, measured via thermography, and vascular permeability in the contralateral (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.3483) and ipsilateral (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.4502) side, measured using spectrophotometry. The obtained data supports the notion that thermography-based temperature assessment can effectively evaluate vascular permeability in the orofacial region.",2023,12,29
Injectable microcapillary network hydrogels engineered by liquid-liquid phase separation for stem cell transplantation.,"Injectable hydrogels are promising carriers for cell delivery in regenerative medicine. However, injectable hydrogels composed of crosslinked polymer networks are often non-microporous and prevent biological communication with host tissues through signals, nutrients, oxygen, and cells, thereby limiting graft survival and tissue integration. Here we report injectable hydrogels with liquid-liquid phase separation-induced microcapillary networks (μCN) as stem cell-delivering scaffolds. The molecular modification of gelatin with hydrogen bonding moieties induced liquid-liquid phase separation when mixed with unmodified gelatin to form μCN structures in the hydrogels. Through spatiotemporally controlled covalent crosslinking and dissolution processes, porous μCN structures were formed in the hydrogels, which can enhance mass transport and cellular activity. The encapsulation of cells with injectable μCN hydrogels improved cellular spreading, migration, and proliferation. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells with injectable μCN hydrogels enhanced graft survival and recovered hindlimb ischemia by enhancing material-tissue communication with biological signals and cells through μCN. This facile approach may serve as an advanced scaffold for improving stem cell transplantation therapies in regenerative medicine.",2023,12,28
Preoperative plasticity in the functional naming network of patients with left insular gliomas.,"Plasticity could take place as a compensatory process following brain glioma growth. Only a few studies specifically explored plasticity in patients affected by a glioma invading the left insula; even more, plasticity of the insular cortex in task-based functional language network is almost unexplored. In the current study, we explored potential plasticity in a consecutive series of 22 patients affected by a glioma centered to the left insula, by comparing their preoperative object-naming functional network with that of a group of healthy controls. After having controlled for demographic variables, fMRI results showed that patients vs. controls activated a cluster in the right, contralesional pars triangularis including the Broca's area. On the other hand, controls did not significantly activate any brain region more than patients. At behavioral level, patients retained a generally preserved naming performance as well as a proficient language processing profile. These findings suggest that involvement of language-specific areas in the healthy hemisphere could help compensate for the left, affected insula, thus allowing preservation of the naming functions. Results are commented in relation to lesion site, naming performance, and potential relevance for neurosurgery.",2023,12,28
Metal-enhanced fluorescence biosensor integrated in capillary flow-driven microfluidic cartridge for highly sensitive immunoassays.,"Point-of-care testing (POCT) for low-concentration protein biomarkers remains challenging due to limitations in biosensor sensitivity and platform integration. This study addresses this gap by presenting a novel approach that integrates a metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) biosensor within a capillary flow-driven microfluidic cartridge (CFMC) for the ultrasensitive detection of the Parkinson's disease biomarker, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex interacting multi-functional protein 2 (AIMP-2). Crucial point to this approach is the orientation-controlled immobilization of capture antibody on a nanodimple-structured MEF substrate within the CFMC. This strategy significantly enhances fluorescence signals without quenching, enabling accurate quantification of low-concentration AIMP-2 using a simple digital fluorescence microscope with a light-emitting diode excitation source and a digital camera. The resulting platform exhibits exceptional sensitivity, achieving a limit of detection in the pg/mL range for AIMP-2 in human serum. Additionally, the CFMC design incorporates a capillary-driven passive sample transport mechanism, eliminating the need for external pumps and further simplifying the detection process. Overall, this work demonstrates the successful integration of MEF biosensing with capillary microfluidics for point-of-care applications.",2023,12,30
Reduced graphene oxide-functionalized polymer microneedle for continuous and wide-range monitoring of lactate in interstitial fluid.,"Despite substantial developments in minimally invasive lactate monitoring microneedle electrodes, most such electrode developments have focused on either sensitivity or invasiveness while ignoring a wide range of detection, which is the most important factor in measuring the normal range of lactate in interstitial fluid (ISF). Herein, we present a polymer-based planar microneedle electrode fabrication using microelectromechanical and femtosecond laser technology for the continuous monitoring of lactate in ISF. The microneedle is functionalized with two-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and electrochemically synthesized platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs). A particular quantity of Nafion (1.25 wt%) is applied on top of the lactate enzyme to create a diffusion-controlled membrane. Due to the combined effects of the planar structure of the microneedle, rGO, and membrane, the biosensor exhibited excellent linearity up to 10 mM lactate with a limit of detection of 2.04 μM, high sensitivity of 43.96 μA mM<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-2</sup>, a reaction time of 8 s and outstanding stability, selectivity, and repeatability. The feasibility of the microneedle is evaluated by using it to measure lactate concentrations in artificial ISF and human serum. The results demonstrate that the microneedle described here has great potential for use in real-time lactate monitoring for use in sports medicine and treatment.",2023,12,21
Differences in organic carbon accumulation in mangrove soils due to foraging by herbivorous crabs.,"Crabs in mangroves could enhance the transfer of organic carbon (OC) from leaf litter to soils, whose variation with the difference in crab size is, however, not well known. A 32-day laboratory feeding experiment was conducted to explore the effects of different sizes of the crabs Parasesarma plicatum foraging on leaf litter of Kandelia obovata on OC accumulation in mangrove soils. Mean rates of soil OC accumulation due to leaf foraging by large, medium, and small crabs were 21.11, 16.11, and 0.77 mg C ind<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to the rates of OC removal from leaf litter of 62.60%, 51.37%, and 2.19%, respectively. Large and medium crabs ingested larger amounts of leaf litter, and soil OC accumulation rates resulting from leaf foraging by large and medium crabs were approximately 8 times higher than those by leaf litter decomposition and triple those by non-leaf foraging. Small crabs ingested the smallest amount of leaf litter, which was almost used for their growth and metabolism. These results underline the key ecological roles of leaf foraging by crabs, especially those with large and medium sizes, in OC accumulation in mangrove soils, which is conducive to estimating carbon sequestration in mangrove soils.",2023,12,30

NiFe codoping-regulated amorphous/crystalline heterostructured Co-based hydroxides/tungstate with rich oxygen vacancies for efficient water oxidation catalysis.,"Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial half-reaction in water splitting, generating hydrogen for sustainable development, but it is often subject to sluggish kinetics. Abundant transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts have been utilized to expedite the process. However, traditional amorphous catalysts suffer from low conductivity, while the activity of crystalline catalysts is also unsatisfactory. Herein, an amorphous/crystalline heterostructured Co-based hydroxide/tungstate was meticulously constructed and further tailored using a NiFe codoping method (NiFeCoW). Following NiFe codoping, the electronic structure had been modulated, subsequently altering the adsorption toward intermediates. From the electrochemical measurements, the NiFeCoW catalyst demonstrated superior electrocatalytic activity for OER in alkaline media, with a minimal overpotential of 297 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and a cell voltage of 1.57 V for water splitting. This study provides valuable guidance for regulating the amorphous/crystalline heterophase in catalysts through bimetallic modulating engineering.",2023,12,24
Fabrication of a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-grafted alginate composite aerogel for efficient treatment of emulsified oily wastewater.,"The treatment of emulsion wastewater poses significant challenges. In this study, a novel porous material, namely esterified bagasse/poly(N, N-dimethylacrylamide)/sodium alginate (SBS/PDMAA/Alg) aerogel, was developed for efficient demulsification and oil recovery. By grafting a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brush onto the SBS/PDMAA/Alg skeleton through free radical polymerization, the resulting aerogel exhibits both surface charge and a molecular brush structure. The aerogel demonstrates remarkable demulsification efficiency for cationic surfactant-stabilized emulsions at various concentrations, achieving a demulsification efficiency of 95.6% even at an oil content of 100 g L<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, the molecular brush structure extends the application range of the aerogel, enabling a demulsification efficiency of 98.3% for anionic and non-ionic surfactant-stabilized emulsions. The interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) structure formed by SBS, PDMAA, and alginate enhances the mechanical stability of the aerogel, enabling a demulsification efficiency of 91.3% even after 20 repeated cycles. The demulsification ability of the composite aerogel is attributed to its surface charge, high interfacial activity, and unique brush-like structure. A demulsification mechanism based on the synergistic effect of surface charge and molecular brush is proposed to elucidate the efficient demulsification process.",2023,12,27
A biocatalytic cascade in enzyme/metal continuous-microflow microgel with stable intermediate channel for point-of-care biosensing.,"A fast and accurate method for ultrasensitive monitoring of substrate is significant for cascade molecular detection. Here, we synthesize a glucose oxidase (GOx) microgel with iron coordination (Fe/GOx microgel). The microgel is cross-linked by chitosan and iron ion coordination which construct a tubular structure. Powder X-ray diffraction and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller results confirm the tubular crystal structure with a high specific surface area is formed in the microgel. The tubular structure offers a stable channel for intermediate transport which ensures the stabilization for the intermediate transport, and high specific surface area enhances the interaction between substrates and catalysts. As a result, the sensitivity of the Fe/GOx microgel is 175.5 μA mM<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> and the lowest detection limit is 4.42 μM. In addition, the nanoscale Fe/GOx microgel also has the characteristics of reusability and maintains its activity after five times of catalysis. The generation of free radicals during the catalytic process can be detected by light detection and electrochemical signal detection within different detection limits. Therefore, Fe/GOx microgel provides a new platform and catalyst for the precise detection of cascade catalysis.",2023,12,21
Atomically dispersed silver atoms incorporated in spinel cobalt oxide (Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) for boosting oxygen evolution reaction.,"Incorporating noble metal single atoms into lattice of spinel cobalt oxide (Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) is an attractive way to fabricate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts because of the high activity and economic benefit. The commonly used high valence noble metal dopants such as ruthenium, iridium and rhodium tend to supersede Co<sup>3+</sup> at octahedral site of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and result in great activity, the origins of admirable activity were also wildly investigated. However, bare explorations on doping noble metal single atom into tetrahedral site of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> to construct OER catalyst have been reported, corresponding catalytic activity and mechanism remain mystery. Here, a promising structure that tetrahedrally substituent Ag single atom embedded in Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles on the surface of carbon nanotube (Ag-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CNT) was presented, and its performance in OER was probed. The high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) demonstrate the successful embeddedness of atomical Ag atom in Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> lattice, the resultant electronic interaction is conducive to promote charge transfer for OER. Theoretical calculations further disclose that atomical Ag dopant prefers to replace tetrahedral Co<sup>2+</sup> rather than octahedral Co<sup>3+</sup>. The substitution Ag acts as the active site through Ag-Co bridge and facilitates the desorption process, which improves the turnover frequency (TOF) and boosts the intrinsic activity of Ag-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CNT. Benefiting from the essentials above, Ag-Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/CNT displays remarkable activity (236 mV@10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>) and robust stability for alkaline OER. This finding offers a potential direction for the design of noble metal single atom involved Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> based OER electrocatalysts.",2023,12,30
Towards smart sustainable cities: Does technological innovation mitigate G7 CO<sub>2</sub> emissions? Fresh evidence from CS-ARDL.,"Sustainable cities are considered paradigmatic to achieve COP27 targets, but scant literature has analyzed the association with CO<sub>2</sub> emission (CE) mitigation policies, especially for the G7 economies. This study traces the impacts of urbanization, innovation, income, and energy consumption on CE for the G7 countries from 1995 to 2019. The time period is important due to the rapid increase in urbanization, globalization, and, at the same time, technology diffusion. The study is focused on novel and relevant panel data econometric methods that tackle cross-section dependence, non-normality of data, and heterogeneity in slope coefficients. The empirical outcome first confirms the long-run cointegrating relationship among the variables in the presence of structural breaks by employing the advanced panel cointegration test. Technologies related to environmental management and energy consumption are positively linked with CE. However, the role of income per capita is found to be inverse with CE. In contrast, the effect of urbanization in different models is mixed for CE. Innovation and its interaction with urbanization are crucial for limiting CE and promoting sustainable cities in G7 economies. This indicates that urbanization with environment-friendly innovation can help G7 countries foster sustainable cities and achieve COP27 targets in general, specifically the Sustainable Development Goal of sustainable cities. The results were tested for the multiplicative effect of different variables with urbanization and innovation. Regarding policy insights, the study recommends focusing on smart and sustainable cities with environment-related innovations and transitioning towards cleaner energy from conventional energy consumption.",2023,12,31
The effects of supplemental dietary chitosan on broiler performance and myopathic features of white striping.,"White striping (WS) is a common myopathy seen in fast-growing broilers. Studies have demonstrated that chitosan is effective as an antioxidant and has antiobesity and fat-absorption reduction properties. We hypothesized that the dietary supplementation of chitosan would have similar effects when fed to fast-growing broilers and would thus lower WS incidence and improve meat quality. One hundred twenty-six broilers were fed corn-soy diets. The grower and finisher diets contained either 0, 0.2, or 0.4% chitosan. After a 6 wk growth period, birds were euthanized, and then WS and gross pathology scores were assessed. Pectoralis major tissues were collected to evaluate cook loss, drip loss, histopathology scores, and the gene expression of CCR7, LECT2, CD36, PPARG, and PTGS2. There were no significant differences between the broiler weights, thus chitosan did not appear to compromise the overall growth of the broilers. Female broilers fed 0.4% chitosan had the lowest WS incidence, while male broiler fed 0.4% chitosan had the least cook loss. However, gene expression analyses did not offer insight into any grossly or histologically visualized differences in the muscles. Thus, while we can postulate that chitosan could have some positive effect in reducing WS incidence and improving meat quality, further studies are required to better scrutinize the mechanisms by which chitosan affects WS and other such myopathies in fast-growing broilers.",2023,12,23
Quantitative ultrasound parameters from scattering and propagation may reduce the biopsy rate for breast tumor.,"Breast cancer has become the most common cancer worldwide, and early screening improves the patient's survival rate significantly. Although pathology with needle-based biopsy is the gold standard for breast cancer diagnosis, it is invasive, painful, and expensive. Meanwhile it makes patients suffer from misplacement of the needle, resulting in misdiagnosis and further assessment. Ultrasound imaging is non-invasive and real-time, however, benign and malignant tumors are hard to differentiate in grayscale B-mode images. We hypothesis that breast tumors exhibit characteristic properties, which generates distinctive spectral patterns not only in scattering, but also during propagation. In this paper, we propose a breast tumor classification method that evaluates the spectral pattern of the tissues both inside the tumor and beneath it. First, quantitative ultrasonic parameters of these spectral patterns were calculated as the representation of the corresponding tissues. Second, parameters were classified by the K-Nearest Neighbor machine learning model. This method was verified with an open access dataset as a reference, and applied to our own dataset to evaluate the potential for tumors assessment. With both datasets, the proposed method demonstrates accurate classification of the tumors, which potentially makes it unnecessary for certain patients to take the biopsy, reducing the rate of the painful and expensive procedure.",2023,12,30
Alterations in mitochondrial structure and function in response to environmental temperature changes in Apostichopus japonicus.,"Global temperatures have risen as a result of climate change, and the resulting warmer seawater will exert physiological stresses on many aquatic animals, including Apostichopus japonicus. It has been suggested that the sensitivity of aquatic poikilothermal animals to climate change is closely related to mitochondrial function. Therefore, understanding the interaction between elevated temperature and mitochondrial functioning is key to characterizing organisms' responses to heat stress. However, little is known about the mitochondrial response to heat stress in A. japonicus. In this work, we investigated the morphological and functional changes of A. japonicus mitochondria under three representative temperatures, control temperature (18 °C), aestivation temperature (25 °C) and heat stress temperature (32 °C) temperatures using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation of mitochondrial morphology combined with proteomics and metabolomics techniques. The results showed that the mitochondrial morphology of A. japonicus was altered, with decreases in the number of mitochondrial cristae at 25 °C and mitochondrial lysis, fracture, and vacuolization at 32 °C. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses revealed 103 differentially expressed proteins and 161 differential metabolites at 25 °C. At 32 °C, the levels of 214 proteins and 172 metabolites were significantly altered. These proteins and metabolites were involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, substance transport, membrane potential homeostasis, anti-stress processes, mitochondrial autophagy, and apoptosis. Furthermore, a hypothetical network of proteins and metabolites in A. japonicus mitochondria in response to temperature changes was constructed based on proteomic and metabolomic data. These results suggest that the dynamic regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism, resistance to oxidative stress, autophagy, apoptosis, and mitochondrial morphology in A. japonicus may play important roles in the response to elevated temperatures. In summary, this study describes the response of A. japonicus mitochondria to temperature changes from the perspectives of morphology, proteins, and metabolites, which provided a better understanding the mechanisms of mitochondrial regulation under environment stress in marine echinoderms.",2023,12,30
Improvement of the setting properties of mineral trioxide aggregate cements using cellulose nanofibrils.,"Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) exhibit excellent mechanical properties and are used to reinforce various composites. The effects of incorporating CNFs into commercial mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) cements (NEX MTA (NEX) and ProRoot<sup>®</sup> MTA (PR)) on the underwater setting properties, compressive strength, and flowability were estimated in this study. NEX mixed without CNFs disintegrated after water immersion. NEX mixed with CNF-suspended solutions showed good setting properties under water immersion and a similar compressive strength, which was kept in air (100% relative humidity). PR did not degrade after water immersion, regardless of the presence of CNFs, and no significant difference in the compressive strength caused by CNFs incorporation was detected. The relative flowability of the NEX mixture decreased with increasing CNFs content up to 1.0 w/v%. The application of CNF-incorporated MTA in various dental cases is promising because CNFs prevent the water-immersion-dependent collapse of some MTA cements immediately after mixing.",2023,12,29
Ultrasound-assisted macroporous resin treatment improves the color and functional properties of sunflower meal protein.,"Sunflower meal protein (SMP) has been considered as a high-quality source of plant protein. However, because the chlorogenic acid (CA) contained in sunflower seed meal was prone to oxidation reactions under traditional alkali extraction conditions, the extracted protein has a dark color and some poor functional properties. To this end, this study used ultrasound-assisted macroporous resin treatment to extract SMP. The improvement effects and potential mechanisms of ultrasonic-assisted macroporous resin treatment with different powers (100, 300, and 500 W) on the color and functional properties of SMP were studied. The results showed that compared with untreated sunflower meal protein (USMP), the lightness value (L*), solubility, emulsification, and gel elasticity were significantly enhanced when treated with 100 W and 300 W ultrasonic-assisted macroporous resin. However, when the ultrasonic power was increased to 500 W, the L* value, solubility, emulsification, and gel elasticity decreased instead, indicating that lower power (100 W and 300 W) ultrasonic-assisted macroporous resin treatment significantly improved the color and functional properties of SMP. Further research found that ultrasound-assisted macroporous resin treatment changed the secondary and tertiary structures of SMP, transformed β-sheet into α-helix and β-turn through rearrangement, and significantly improved surface hydrophobicity. It shows that ultrasonic-assisted macroporous resin treatment expands the SMP structure and exposes hydrophobic groups, thereby improving the color and functional properties of SMP. This study provides a potential strategy for extracting SMP with light color and good functional properties. It also provides a theoretical basis for the wide application of SMP in food processing.",2023,12,30
Building a Multidisciplinary Care Pathway Supported by a Surgical Approach to Local Bone Formation.,"Osteoporosis is the most common disease of bone mineral metabolism. In Spain, it affects approximately 3 million people, of whom 80% are females and 20% are males. Despite the advances that have been made in this field, we continue to witness alarming levels of fragility hip fractures. In 2010, the cost of osteoporosis in the European Union was estimated to be 37,000 million euros, which included the costs for the treatment of incident fractures (66%), pharmacological prevention (5%), and long-term fracture care (29%). A multidisciplinary care pathway supported by a surgical approach to local bone formation is needed. Recently, the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis (ESCEO) included in their treatment guidelines a local osteo-enhancement procedure (LOEP) as a treatment option. In the Ossure™ LOEP technique (AgNovos Healthcare USA, LLC, Rockville, MD), a calcium-based triphasic osteoconductive implant material (AGN1), which has been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and proximal femoral strength, is introduced percutaneously in the femoral neck and intertrochanteric region. Basically, the procedure consists of three percutaneous steps: prepare, clean, and fill the cavity with AGN1. It can be carried out with sedation and local anaesthesia or spinal anaesthesia. This report presents a clinical case and discusses how to select patients who could potentially benefit from this technique.",2023,12,29
Understanding the Biering-Sørensen test: Contributors to extensor endurance in young adults with and without a history of low back pain.,"The Biering-Sørensen test is commonly used to assess paraspinal muscle endurance. Research using a single repetition of the test has provided conflicting evidence for the contribution of impaired paraspinal muscle endurance to low back pain (LBP). This study investigated how Sørensen test duration, muscle activation, and muscle fatigability are affected by multiple repetitions of the test and determined predictors of Sørensen test duration in young adults with and without a history of LBP. Sixty-four young individuals performed three repetitions of the Sørensen test. Amplitude of activation and median frequency slope (fatigability) were calculated for the lumbar and thoracic paraspinals and hamstrings. Duration of the test was significantly less for the 3rd repetition in individuals with LBP. In individuals without LBP, test duration was predicted by fatigability of the lumbar paraspinals. In individuals with LBP, Sørensen test duration was predicted by fatigability of the hamstrings and amplitude of activation of the thoracic and lumbar paraspinals. Our findings demonstrate that it is necessary to amplify the difficulty of the Sørensen test to reveal impairments in young, active adults with LBP. Training programs aiming to improve lumbar paraspinal performance should monitor performance of other synergist muscles during endurance exercise.",2023,12,27
Enhancing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) therapy with targeted carbon nano-onion (CNO)-mediated delivery of gemcitabine (GEM)-derived prodrugs.,"Nanotechnology's potential in revolutionising cancer treatments is evident in targeted drug delivery systems (DDSs) engineered to optimise therapeutic efficacy and minimise toxicity. This study examines a novel nanocarrier constructed with carbon nano-onions (CNOs), engineered and evaluated for its ability to selectively target cancer cells overexpressing the hyaluronic acid receptor; CD44. Our results highlighted that the CNO-based nanocarrier coupled with hyaluronic acid as the targeting agent demonstrated effective uptake by CD44+ PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells, while avoiding CD44- Capan-1 cells. The CNO-based nanocarrier also exhibited excellent biocompatibility in all tested pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, as well as healthy cells. Notably, the CNO-based nanocarrier was successfully loaded with chemotherapeutic 4-(N)-acyl- sidechain-containing prodrugs derived from gemcitabine (GEM). These prodrugs alone exhibited remarkable efficacy in killing PDAC cells which are known to be GEM resistant, and their efficacy was amplified when combined with the CNO-based nanocarrier, particularly in targeting GEM-resistant CD44+ PDAC cells. These findings demonstrate the potential of CNOs as promising scaffolds in advancing targeted DDSs, signifying the translational potential of carbon nanoparticles for cancer therapy.",2023,12,30
Negative photoperiod induces an increase in the number of ovulations in dairy cattle.,"This study sought to examine the impact of negative photoperiod on the incidence of multiple ovulations and pregnancies in dairy cattle. The study population consisted of 5,373 pregnant cows in their third or greater lactation that experienced their first post-partum pregnancy after spontaneous estrus. The positive photoperiod (increasing day-length) extends from December 22 to June 21, whereas the negative photoperiod (decreasing day-length) extends from June 22 to December 21. The odds ratios (ORs) for multiple ovulations and pregnancies in cows that became pregnant during the negative photoperiod and the remaining cows that became pregnant during the positive photoperiod were 1.4 and 1.3 (P < 0.0001), respectively. The ORs for cows that became pregnant ≥ 90 days in milk and the remaining cows that became pregnant < 90 days in milk were 4.3 and 4.1 (P < 0.0001), respectively. No significant differences were detected in the monthly rates of multiple ovulations or pregnancies during positive and negative photoperiods. Thus, the present study demonstrates that the ovarian function in cows is related to changes in day-length, with decreasing day-length being associated with greater multiple ovulation and pregnancy rates. The present study also shows that positive and negative photoperiods exhibit different trends. The results of this study are consistent with a growing body of work demonstrating the effects of photoperiod patterns on the reproductive physiology of cows, with clear implications for twin pregnancy prevention.",2023,12,29
Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and MXene reinforced multifunctional conductive hydrogels for multimodal sensors and flexible supercapacitors.,"With the growing demand for eco-friendly materials in wearable smart electronic devices, renewable, biocompatible, and low-cost hydrogels based on natural polymers have attracted much attention. Cellulose, as one of the renewable and degradable natural polymers, shows great potential in wearable smart electronic devices. Multifunctional conductive cellulose-based hydrogels are designed for flexible electronic devices by adding sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and MXene into polyacrylic acid networks. The multifunctional hydrogels possess excellent mechanical property (stress: 310 kPa; strain: 1127 %), toughness (206.67 KJ m<sup>-3</sup>), conductivity (1.09 ± 0.12 S m<sup>-1</sup>) and adhesion (82.19 ± 3.65 kPa). The multifunctional conductive hydrogels serve as strain sensors (Gauge Factor (GF) = 5.79, 0-700 % strain; GF = 14.0, 700-900 % strain; GF = 40.36, 900-1000 % strain; response time: 300 ms; recovery time: 200 ms) and temperature sensors (Temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) = 2.5755 °C<sup>-1</sup> at 35 °C- 60 °C). The sensor detects human activities with clear and steady signals. A distributed array of flexible sensors is created to measure the magnitude and distribution of pressure and a hydrogel-based flexible touch keyboard is also fabricated to recognize writing trajectories, pressures and speeds. Furthermore, a flexible hydrogel-based supercapacitor powers the LED and exhibits good cyclic stability over 15,000 charge-discharge cycles.",2023,12,12
Behavioral plasticity during acute heat stress: heat hardening increases the expression of boldness.,"Climate change is creating novel thermal environments via rising temperatures and increased frequency of severe weather events. Short-term phenotypic adjustments, i.e., phenotypic plasticity, may facilitate species persistence during adverse environmental conditions. A plastic response that increases thermal tolerance is heat hardening, which buffers organisms from extreme heat and may enhance short term survival. However, heat hardening responses may incur a cost with concomitant decreases in thermal preference and physiological performance. Thus, phenotypic shifts accompanying a hardening response may be maladaptive in warming climates. Understanding how heat hardening influences other traits associated with fitness and survival will clarify its potential as an adaptive response to altered thermal niches. Here, we studied the effects of heat hardening on boldness behavior in the color polymorphic tree lizard, Urosaurus ornatus. Boldness in lizards influences traits such as territory maintenance, mating success, and survivorship and is repeatable in U. ornatus. We found that when lizards underwent a heat hardening response, boldness expression significantly increased. This trend was driven by males. Bolder individuals also exhibited lower field active body temperatures. This behavioral response to heat hardening may increase resource holding potential and territoriality in stressful environments but may also increase predation risk. This study highlights the need to detail associated phenotypic shifts with stress responses to fully understand their adaptive potential in rapidly changing environments.",2023,12,27
Postoperative mediastinitis and sternal osteitis after cardiac surgery caused by Mycoplasma hominis: A case report.,Mediastinitis and sternal osteitis are critical complications in cardiac surgery. Cases of these complications caused by Mycoplasma hominis are extremely rare.,2023,12,31
Intercomparison and constancy check of brachytherapy well-type chambers as a means to improve the quality of measurements in Serbia.,"Source strength measurements are of critical importance for brachytherapy and are often performed in hospitals using well-type chambers. Quality assurance and quality control procedures should be implemented, but that may prove difficult in some hospitals due to the lack of equipment or metrological support. A study was conducted to investigate the status of the measurement equipment in Serbian hospitals and to organize an intercomparison campaign using a hospital <sup>192</sup>Ir source. All the hospitals were able to measure the source strength with the required accuracy, but the quality assurance can be improved. Two hospitals performed stability checks, which were evaluated. Uncertainty budget was created during the exercise and is presented in this paper. The described methodology can be used to quickly assess the performance of brachytherapy centers, and can be easily adapted to calibration procedure.",2023,12,23
"First detection of the Jingmen tick virus in Amblyomma testudinarium ticks from the Kanto district, Japan.","In 2010, the Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) was discovered in ticks in China and has been shown to be distributed in several regions worldwide. Recently, cases of JMTV infection in humans have been reported in China and Kosovo, attracting much attention as an emerging tick-borne disease. In this study, we detected the JMTV genome in Amblyomma testudinarium ticks collected in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, during tick-borne virus surveillance conducted in the Kanto district. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the new JMTV strain is closely related to previous strains detected in Japan. This suggests that JMTV may have been maintained during an independent natural transmission cycle in Japan. In addition, unlike in other countries and regions, all JMTV strains in Japan were detected only in A. testudinarium ticks, suggesting that this tick species is the primary JMTV vector in Japan. This report is the first to detect JMTV in the Kanto region. Further studies are required to elucidate the potential risk of infection by this tick-borne virus in Japan. In particular, the prevalence of JMTV in wild animals should be examined to clarify its geographical distribution, host range, and transmission cycle in nature.",2023,12,28
Immunohistochemical staining of versican as a potential marker for predicting lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer.,"Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers and has a high mortality rate. Lymph node metastasis is a key determinant of prognosis, and an essential mechanism involved in metastasis is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In this study, we aimed to assess the diagnostic role of versican (VCAN), a molecule participating in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, on the detection of metastatic cancer. The expression of VCAN was evaluated using immunohistochemistry, and its biological activity was examined using gastric cancer cell lines. In patients with lymph node metastasis, VCAN expression was more prominent at primary tumor sites. In addition, VCAN was found to promote cell migration in vitro, thus potentially facilitating the distribution of metastases. Overall, increased expression of VCAN at the primary site may signify the development of metastases in lymph nodes because this protein is recognized as contributing to the migration of cancer cells into lymph nodes.",2023,12,21
A novel ratiometric fluorescence probe based on the FRET-ICT mechanism for detecting fluoride ions and viscosity.,"Fluoride ion is not only important for dental health, but also a contributing factor in a variety of diseases. At the same time, fluoride ions and cell viscosity are both important to the physiological environment of mitochondria. We developed a dual-response ratiometric fluorescent probe BDF based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism for the detection of F<sup>-</sup> and viscosity. BDF has an outstanding intramolecular energy transfer efficiency of 97.7% and shows excellent performance for fluorine ion detection. In addition, when the system viscosity increases, the fluorescence emission intensity of BDF is greatly heightened, indicating the possibility of viscosity detection. Finally, based on the fluorescence properties of BDF, we used the probe to detect F<sup>-</sup> in the toothpaste sample and image exogenous fluoride ions in HeLa cells.",2023,12,30
Photoelectrochemical sensor for the detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7 based on TPA-NO<sub>2</sub> and dual-functional polythiophene films.,"The detection of Escherichia coli (E. coli) is of great significance for the environment and human health. Herein, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) detection strategy based on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) was proposed for the sensitive detection of E. coli. 4,4',4″-Trinitrotriphenylamine (TPA-NO<sub>2</sub>) was prepared using a simple nitration reaction. Subsequently, MIP films were polymerized on the surface of TPA-NO<sub>2</sub> using 1,3-dihydrothieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione as the functional monomer with the dual functions of specific recognition and sensitization. The linear range was 10-10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL and the limit of detection was 10 CFU/mL. It showed favorable recoveries in real sample tests of milk, orange juice and tomato. Additionally, the ability of functional monomers to bind excellently with E. coli was verified using molecular docking techniques. This research provided broader possibilities for constructing MIPs-PEC sensors and analyzing the interaction mechanism between E. coli and functional monomers.",2023,12,30
[One-way membrane decompression for vital pulp therapy in irreversible pulpitis: a case report].,"Irreversible pulpitis is characterized by inflammation of the pulp, leading to secondary interstitial hypertension and blood circulation disorders. This study explores the development of one-way membrane decompression to alleviate interstitial hypertension in the inflamed pulp and prevent the invasion of oral microorganisms into the pulp tissue. Additionally, this technique aims to improve the microcirculation of the pulp tissue by consistently reducing the pressure within the pulp cavity. Once the inflamed pulp tissue is restored, permanent crown filling can be performed. In this paper, we present a case study involving a patient with irreversible pulpitis who underwent vital pulp treatment using the one-way decompressed membrane. A four-year follow-up evaluation revealed satisfactory outcomes.",2023,12,29
Use of a stent-retriever for treatment of iatrogenic vasospasm secondary to mechanical thrombectomy.,"The treatment strategy for iatrogenic intracranial vasospasm has not been established. We reported a rare case of stent-retriever use for the treatment of iatrogenic vasospasm after mechanical thrombectomy. The patient presented acute ischemic stroke due to the occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). The patient underwent a successfully mechanical thrombectomy, however, severe stenosis was visualized in MCA, which was considered to be an iatrogenic mechanical vasospasm. This vasospasm was successfully treated with the Solitaire stent device, and the patient recovered from ischemic symptoms. A stent-retriever is a safe and effective treatment for iatrogenic vasospasm after mechanical thrombectomy.",2023,12,30
A near-infrared aggregation-induced emission photosensitizer targeting mitochondria for depleting Cu<sup>2+</sup> to trigger light-activated cancer cells oncosis.,"Abnormally high levels of copper in tumors stimulate malignant proliferation and migration of cancer cells, which proposes a formidable challenge for the thorough therapy of malignant tumors. In this work, we developed a reliable, mitochondria-targeted near-infrared aggregation-induced emission fluorescent probe, TTQ-Th, whose thiourea moiety specifically could recognize mitochondria even both upon loss of mitochondrial membrane potential or in fixated cells, and can capture copper overexpressed by tumor cells, leading to severe copper deficiency. In parallel, TTQ-Th can generate sufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon photoexcitation, while copper deficiency inhibits expression of related copper-based enzymes, resulting in a decline in ATP production. Such energy deficiency, combined with reduced MMP and elevated oxidative stress can lead to critical cell oncosis. Both in vitro and intracellular experiments can illustrate that the elevated ROS has remarkable damage to tumor cells and contributes to the elimination of the primary tumor, while copper deficiency further hinder tumor cell migration and induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner, which is an efficacious strategy for the treatment of malignant tumors.",2023,12,10
Synthesis of fluorescent carbon dots by B/P doping and application for Co<sup>2+</sup> and methylene blue detection.,"During the synthesis of carbon dots, different heteroatom doping can change the fluorescence color and the emission wavelength when the same precursor is applied. In this study, we used o-phenylenediamine and L-lysine as raw materials, boric acid or phosphoric acid as different heteroatom dopants, and water as solvent to synthesize doped carbon dots through a simple microwave-assisted method. Finally, two kinds of doped carbon dots with different fluorescence colors under 365 nm UV light were obtained, of which the B-doped carbon dots (B-CDs) showed orange fluorescence, and the P-doped carbon dots (P-CDs) showed red fluorescence. Both carbon dots had satisfactory fluorescence quantum yields and can be used as fluorescence probes. Therefore, we investigated the detection performance of these two carbon dots when they were used as fluorescent probes. B-CDs can selectively detect Co<sup>2+</sup> with a detection limit of 0.1102 μM, and at the same time, it can realize the naked eye detection of Co<sup>2+</sup> in a certain concentration range. The P-CDs could sensitively detect methylene blue with a detection limit of 0.048 μM.",2023,12,30
"Analysis of the spatial distribution of the landslides triggered by the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake, Japan.","The Great Kanto Earthquake that occurred in the southern part of Kanto district, Japan, on September 1, 1923, was reported to have triggered numerous landslides (over 89,080 slope failures over an area of 86.32 km<sup>2</sup>). This study investigated the relationship between the landslide occurrence caused by this earthquake and geomorphology, geology, soil, seismic ground motion, and coseismic deformation. We found that a higher landslide density was mainly related to a larger absolute curvature and a higher slope angle, as well as to several geological units (Neogene plutonic rock, accretionary prism, and metamorphic rocks). Moreover, we performed decision tree analyses, which showed that slope angle, geology, and coseismic deformation were correlated to landslide density in that order. However, no clear correlation was found between landslide density and seismic ground motion. These results suggest that landslide density was greater in areas of large slope angle or fragile geology in the area with strong shaking enough to trigger landslides.",2023,12,29
Probing the mechanism of the dedicated NO sensor [4Fe-4S] NsrR: the effect of cluster ligand environment.,"NsrR from Streptomyces coelicolor is a bacterial nitric oxide (NO) sensor/nitrosative stress regulator as its primary function, and has been shown to have differential response at low, mid, and high levels of NO. These must correspond to discrete structural changes at the protein-bound [4Fe-4S] cluster in response to stepwise nitrosylation of the cluster. We have investigated the effect of the monohapto carboxylate ligand in the site differentiated [4Fe-4S] cluster cofactor of the protein NsrR on modulating its reactivity to NO with a focus on indentifying mechanistic intermediates. We have prepared a synthetic model [4Fe-4S] cluster complex with tripodal ligand and one single site differentiated site occupied by either thiolate or carboxylate ligand. We report here the mechanistic details of sequential steps of nitrosylation as observed by ESI MS and IR spectroscopy. Parallel non-denaturing mass spectrometry analyses were performed using site-differentiated variants of NsrR with the native aspartic acid, cysteine, or alanine in the position of the forth ligand to the cluster. A mono-nitrosylated synthetic [4Fe-4S] cluster was observed for the first time in a biologically-relevant thiolate-based coordination environment. Combined synthetic and protein data give unprecedented clarity in the modulation of nitrosylation of a [4Fe-4S] cluster.",2023,12,21
Effect of porcelain veneering technique in bilayered zirconia on bond strength and residual stress distribution.,"The use of all porcelain materials in dentistry has significantly increased in recent years. However, chipping has remained a common problem that affects bilayered zirconia restorations. Bonding between porcelain and the underlying zirconia framework is crucial to the success of the restoration. The bond strength may be affected by such factors as residual thermal stress and the veneering technique. This research focuses on investigating the potential and constraints of materials through an examination of the porcelain veneering technique, particularly hand-layering and heat-pressing. Forty-two cylindrical disc samples of zirconia (n = 7/group) were fabricated in the dimensions of 10 × 1.2 mm (diameter [D] × height [H]). The zirconia specimens were milled from IPS e.max® ZirCad [Z] block and Luxen Zr [L] block (n = 21/zirconia). The zirconia cores were layered with IPS e.max® Zirliner and heat-pressed with IPS e.max® ZirPress to produce a final veneer dimension of 5 × 3 mm (D × H). Conventional layering was performed for the rest of the zirconia cores using IPS e.max® Ceram and Shofu Vintage Zr. The final study groups were Luxen-Vintage (LV), Luxen-Ceram (LC), Luxen Zirpress (LP), ZirCad-Vintage (ZV), ZirCad-Ceram (ZC) and ZirCad-Zirpress (ZP). Five samples were subjected to shear bond testing (SBS) with a universal testing machine with a 5 kN load cell and 0.5 mm/min crosshead speed (n = 5/group). A sample underwent nanoindentation, and another was sectioned using Isomet machine to study the bonding interface. One-way ANOVA was used to run the statistical analyses of the SBS test. Statistical differences were found between ZV with LC and LP (p < 0.05). Residual stress is estimated to be higher in the middle of the porcelain compared with that on the surface and the interface. FESEM imaging reveals portions of visible bare zirconia on Luxen zirconia, whilst crack propagation occurred through voids in all hand-layered groups. Heat-pressed veneering showed comparable but not superior results to conventional hand-layered veneering. Heat-pressed veneering produced similar stress distribution profiles compared with hand-layered veneering.",2023,12,29
Optimization and verification of selective removal of organophosphate esters from wastewater by molecularly imprinted adsorbent.,"Tributyl phosphate (TNBP), a new type of flame retardant, is an emerging pollutant and has been frequently detected in various matrices such as wastewater. Efficient removal of TNBP is critical for wastewater treatment. In this study, molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was prepared using precipitation polymerization for selective adsorption of TNBP. The results showed that MIP had a porous structure and formed effective imprinting cavities, which was primarily responsible for its superior adsorption ability. The adsorption of TNBP by MIP was carried out following both the pseudo-secondary kinetic model and the Langmuir isothermal adsorption model. MIP adsorbed TNBP rapidly and reached adsorption equilibrium within 30 min with 923 μmol g<sup>-1</sup> at 298 K. The adsorption capacity and adsorption rate of MIP were respectively 2 and 5.49 times those of non-molecularly imprinted polymers. In addition, MIP could effectively counter disturbances from external parameters like temperature and pH, exhibiting strong environmental flexibility. MIP can specifically adsorb organophosphate esters, and can selectively adsorb TNBP under the interference of coexisting contaminants such as1,3-diphenylguanidine and isazofos. In actual bodies of water, MIP's highly selective adsorption of TNBP retains its advantage. The selective adsorption of MIP was mainly due to the common phosphate skeleton, and the specific substituent of organophosphate esters played an important role in the imprinting process. Hydrogen bonding might be involved in the polymerization process of TNBP with acrylamide and the adsorption process of TNBP by MIP.MIP exhibited good reuse efficiency, the total adsorption capacity decreased by no more than 25% after 7 reuse cycles. This study provides a simple and efficient method for selective removal of organophosphate from wastewater.",2023,12,31
"Ultrasound-assisted extraction of polyphenols from pine needles (Pinus elliottii): Comprehensive insights from RSM optimization, antioxidant activity, UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS/MS analysis and kinetic model.","Extracting polyphenolic bioactive compounds from Pinus elliottii needles, a forestry residue, promises economic and environmental benefits, however, relevant experimental data are lacking. Herein, a comprehensive investigation of the polyphenolic composition of pine needles (PNs) was carried out. Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction (UAE) was applied to extract the polyphenolic compounds of pine needles. The optimal conditions of extracts were determined by Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The maximum total phenolic content (TPC) of 40.37 mg GAE/g PNs was achieved with solid-liquid ratio of 1:20, 60 % ethanol, and 350 W for 25 min at 45 °C. Polyphenolic extracts showed antioxidant activity in scavenging free radicals and reducing power (DPPH, IC<sub>50</sub> 41.05 μg/mL; FRAP 1.09 mM Fe<sup>2+</sup>/g PNs; ABTS, IC<sub>50</sub> 214.07 μg/mL). Furthermore, the second-order kinetic model was also constructed to describe the mechanism of the UAE process, with the extraction activation energy estimated at 12.26 kJ/mol. In addition, 37 compounds in PNs were first identified by UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS/MS, including flavonoids and phenolic acids. The results suggest that Ultrasound-Assisted is an effective method for the extraction of natural polyphenolic compounds from pine needles and this study could serve as a foundation for utilizing phenolics derived from PNs in the food and pharmaceutical industries.",2023,12,23
Developmental Biology: from genes to functional organism - news from the 3<sup>rd</sup> Meeting of the Visegrád Group Society for Developmental Biology.,"The third meeting of the Visegrád Group Society for Developmental Biology (V4SDB) was held on September 8<sup>th</sup>-10<sup>th</sup>, 2023 in Warsaw, Poland. It was a continuation of previous meetings, the first organized in the Czech Republic in 2018 and the second in Hungary in 2021.

[Comparison of three-dimensional position of maxillary dentition model treated by two digital transfer methods].,"<b>Objective:</b> To compare and evaluate the difference in maxillary dentition position using an anatomical facebow and jaw movement analyzer. <b>Methods:</b> From March to May 2023, 15 medical interns from Yantai Stomatological Hospital were recruited, including 9 males and 6 females, aged 20-25 years. Digital models and plaster models of maxillary dentition were obtained from the 15 medical interns. The anatomical facebow group (AFB) and jaw movement analyzer group (JMA) were used to transfer the position of the maxillary dentition to the virtual articulator. The virtual occlusal articulator module of exocad denture design software was used to measure the inclination angle of the occlusal plane of the two groups, the distance between the mesio-incisal angle of the left maxillary central incisor and the lateral center point of the lateral condylar sphere of the virtual occlusal articulator, the distance between the mesial buccal cusp of the maxillary first molar and the lateral center point of the lateral condyle sphere of the virtual articulator. The same marks (mesial incisor point of left maxillary central incisor and mesial buccal cusp point of both maxillary first molars) were measured in two groups of maxillary dentition, and the root-mean-square error between 3 points was calculated. <b>Results:</b> The occlusal plane inclination angle in AFB group (9.11°±3.85°) was significantly larger than that in JMA group (4.94°±2.69°) (<i>t</i>=10.45, <i>P</i><0.001). There were significant differences between AFB and JMA groups. The distances from the mesial cusp of the left first molar to the lateral center of the left condylar, from the mesial cusp of the left maxillary central incisor to the lateral center of the left condylar[(91.75±3.05), (129.09±4.60) mm]were significantly smaller than those in the JMA group[(95.68±5.45), (132.41±5.64) mm](<i>t</i>=-4.48, <i>P</i>=0.001; <i>t</i>=-4.21, <i>P</i>=0.001). In both groups of models, the distance of the mesial cusp of the left maxillary central incisor was (8.81±2.56) mm, and the distance between mesial buccal cusp of maxillary left first molar was (7.56±2.49) mm, the distance between mesial buccal cusp of maxillary right first molar was (7.13±2.77) mm; the root mean square error was (7.93±2.94) mm. Compared with 0, the difference was statistically significant (<i>t</i>=10.45, <i>P</i><0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> There were differences between the two methods (anatomical facebow and the jaw movement analyzer) for transferring the maxillary dentition position to the three-dimensional space position of the virtual articulator.",2023,12,29
Evaluating the diagnostic performance of Liaison® chemiluminescence assay as screening tool for detection of acute Epstein-Barr infection: A comparative study.,"The present investigation assessed the Liaison® diagnostic performance in detecting Epstein-Barr (EBV) IgM-VCA in a large patient cohort, considering age and symptomatology. VIDAS® were employed as a benchmark for acute EBV infection. The study also probed other coexisting conditions and potential cross-reactivity for error sources. A total of 1311 samples were analyzed, with notable associations found only among paediatric (kappa=0.75) and young adult (kappa=0.58) populations with compatible symptoms. ROC analysis revealed varying optimal cutoff values based on age and symptom categorizations. Logistic regression models identified age and patients from Oncology or Infectious Disease as significant factors for false positives. Potential interferences emerged with RF, ANCA, cytomegalovirus-IgM and VHS-IgM. Notably, Liaison® couldn´t distinguish EBV patients from Oncology, Haemathology or Internal Medicine. This study provides valuable insights, such as implementing ageand symptom-specific thresholds or reviewing test requests, for optimizing EBV serology in microbiology laboratories, leading to faster and more reliable responses.",2023,12,24
An efficient artificial intelligence algorithm for predicting the sensory quality of green and black teas based on the key chemical indices.,"The key components dominating the quality of green tea and black tea are still unclear. Here, we respectively produced green and black teas in March and June, and investigated the correlations between sensory quality and chemical compositions of dry teas by multivariate statistics, bioinformatics and artificial intelligence algorithm. The key chemical indices were screened out to establish tea sensory quality-prediction models based on the result of OPLS-DA and random forest, namely 4 flavonol glycosides of green tea and 8 indices of black tea (4 pigments, epigallocatechin, kaempferol-3-O-rhamnosyl-glucoside, ratios of caffeine/total catechins and epi/non-epi catechins). Compared with OPLS-DA and random forest, the support vector machine model had good sensory quality-prediction performance for both green tea and black tea (F1-score > 0.92), even based on the indices of fresh tea leaves. Our study explores the potential of artificial intelligence algorithm in classification and prediction of tea products with different sensory quality.",2023,12,31
"Esterified wheat bran: Physicochemical properties, structure and quality improvement of Chinese steamed bread during refrigerated storage.","To develop the application of wheat bran and improve the nutrition and anti-staling capacity of Chinese steamed bread (CSB), oleic acid-esterified wheat bran (OWB) was prepared by esterification of wheat bran with oleic acid, and its physicochemical properties, structure, and quality improvement for CSB during refrigerated storage were investigated. The hydrophilic-lipophilic balance value of OWB was 16.0, the maximum degree of substitution was 0.146, and its emulsifying capacity was similar to that of glycerol monostearate. The starch gelatinization degree of CSB containing 3 % OWB and the control decreased by 19.55 % and 27.12 % within 7 days of refrigerated storage, respectively, while the hardness of CSB with OWB was lower than that with wheat bran. OWB inhibited starch recrystallization and increased bound water in the corresponding CSB, which effectively delayed starch retrogradation. OWB had a positive emulsifying capacity and showed potential as a functional material for preventing retrogradation of starch-based foods.",2023,12,31

Development of an analytic method for organosulfur compounds in Welsh onion and its use for nutritional quality analysis of five typical varieties in China.,"A reliable, simple, and sensitive method capable of quantifying six organosulfur compounds (OSCs) was established. The samples were extracted by water containing 3 % formic acid with a simple vortex, ultrasound, and centrifugation step, and the solutions were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography separation system coupled with a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC - MS/MS). Then the method was applied for the analysis of six OSCs in five varieties of two types Welsh onions in China, and the moisture content, reducing sugar, total polyphenols, and 21 free amino acids were also analyzed to study the characters of these Welsh onions intensively. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to investigate the differences in OSCs and free amino acids profiles among the samples. This study showed that enzymatic inhibition method combined with UHPLC - MS/MS is an effective technique to analyze OSCs in Welsh onion, and could be valuable for the routine quantitation of OSCs in other foods.",2023,12,21
"Integrating pollutant levels and biochemical biomarkers in oysters (Crassostrea rhizophorae and Crassostrea gasar) indicates anthropic impacts on marine environments along the coast of Santa Catarina state, Brazil.","This study aimed to carry out a general diagnosis of the contamination of the coastal marine environment of the Santa Catarina state (SC, Brazil) by different classes of environmental pollutants, as well as to evaluate possible adverse effects of the contaminants on biochemical biomarkers of oysters, Crassostrea gasar and Crassostrea rhizophorae. 107 chemicals were evaluated in water, sediment and oyster samples from nine sites along the coastline of SC. We also examined various biochemical biomarkers in the oysters' gills and digestive glands to assess potential effects of contaminants. In general, the northern and central regions of the littoral of SC presented higher occurrences and magnitudes of contaminants than the southern region, which is probably related to higher urbanization of center and northern areas of the littoral. The biomarker analysis in the oysters reflected these contamination patterns, with more significant alterations observed in regions with higher levels of pollutants. Our results may serve as a first baseline for future and more extensive monitoring actions and follow-up of the degree of contamination in the state, allowing for inspection actions and management of areas most affected by marine pollutants.",2023,12,20
A novel method for determination of peroxide value and acid value of extra-virgin olive oil based on fluorescence internal filtering effect correction.,"Peroxide value (PV) and acid value (AV) are widely used indicators for evaluating oxidation degree of olive oils. Fluorescence spectroscopy has been extensively studied on the detection of oil oxidation, however, the detection accuracy is limited due to internal filtering effect (IFE). Due to the primary and secondary IFE, at least two wavelengths of absorption information are required. Least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) models for PV and AV were established based on two absorption coefficients (μ<sub>a</sub>) at 375 nm and emission wavelength and one fluorescence intensity at corresponding wavelength. The regression results proved that the model based on 375 and 475 nm could reach the best performance, with the highest correlation coefficient for prediction (r<sub>p</sub>) of 0.889 and 0.960 for PV and AV respectively. Finally, the explicit formulations for PV and AV were determined by nonlinear least squares fitting, and the r<sub>p</sub> could reach above 0.94 for two indicators.",2023,12,30

Residual effects of chlorinated organic pollutants on microbial community and natural redox processes in coastal wetlands.,"Chlorinated organic pollutants (COPs) are common in flooded environments. To examine the residual status and effects of COPs on flooded environments, a survey of 7 coastal wetlands in Zhejiang, East China was conducted. Total COP concentrations detected from 95.69 to 412.76 ng g<sup>-1</sup> dw. Gamma-HCH and o,p'-DDT posed the greatest risk with exceedance rates of 100% according to sediment quality guidelines. Samples with higher COP pollution had higher microbial diversity, more complex microbial networks, more deterministic community assembly processes and lower microbiome stability, indicating an improved soil function for balance cycle of substances, especially for COP degradation. Further analysis using quantitative real-time PCR suggested COP-dechlorination interacted with natural redox processes, especially sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. The positive correlation between CH<sub>4</sub> and pentachlorobenzene indicated a potential increase in greenhouse gas emissions caused by COP pollution. Correlation between dsr gene and COPs demonstrated the ability of sulfate-reducing bacteria to degrade COPs. Particularly, facultative OHRB such as sulfate-reducing bacteria hold significant importance in the process of COP-dechlorination. This finding provides a reference for COP pollution remediation. Collectively, our study offers new insight into the residual effect of COPs in coastal wetlands and contributes to an improved understanding of bioremediation strategies for COP pollution.",2023,12,23

Dual-correlate optimized coarse-fine strategy for monocular laparoscopic videos feature matching via multilevel sequential coupling feature descriptor.,"Feature matching of monocular laparoscopic videos is crucial for visualization enhancement in computer-assisted surgery, and the keys to conducting high-quality matches are accurate homography estimation, relative pose estimation, as well as sufficient matches and fast calculation. However, limited by various monocular laparoscopic imaging characteristics such as highlight noises, motion blur, texture interference and illumination variation, most exiting feature matching methods face the challenges of producing high-quality matches efficiently and sufficiently. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel sequential coupling feature descriptor to extract and express multilevel feature maps efficiently, and a dual-correlate optimized coarse-fine strategy to establish dense matches in coarse level and adjust pixel-wise matches in fine level. Firstly, a novel sequential coupling swin transformer layer is designed in feature descriptor to learn and extract multilevel feature representations richly without increasing complexity. Then, a dual-correlate optimized coarse-fine strategy is proposed to match coarse feature sequences under low resolution, and the correlated fine feature sequences is optimized to refine pixel-wise matches based on coarse matching priors. Finally, the sequential coupling feature descriptor and dual-correlate optimization are merged into the Sequential Coupling Dual-Correlate Network (SeCo DC-Net) to produce high-quality matches. The evaluation is conducted on two public laparoscopic datasets: Scared and EndoSLAM, and the experimental results show the proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in homography estimation, relative pose estimation, reprojection error, matching pairs number and inference runtime.

Development of microemulgel formulations with varied permeation enhancers for transungual delivery of luliconazole in onychomycosis management.,"Luliconazole-loaded microemulgels containing different permeation enhancers were formulated for transungual drug delivery for the management of onychomycosis, onychomycosis, which affects nails. The physicochemical properties like droplet size, zeta potential, pH, viscosity, spreadability, extrudability, oil binding capacity, drug content, and microscopic study were evaluated. The Pseudo-ternary phase diagram was constructed for the formulation of microemulsions (MEs) by keeping the K<sub>m</sub> ratio constant at 3:1 and characterized for clarity, mean droplet size, zeta potential, viscosity, pH, transmittance, refractive index, and stability. The ME mean droplet size and zeta potential were found in the range of 38.78 to 171.4 nm, and 0.00 to - 6.6 mV, respectively. Prepared MEs were converted into microemulgel by adding a 2.5% gelling agent (Carbapol 934) in the external phase, and a drug release study was conducted. Formulation E3 showed better drug release and was chosen as the control. Four different penetration enhancers were added separately within E3 and further evaluated for pH, viscosity, spreadability, extrudability, oil binding capacity, drug content, microscopic study, Compatibility study, XRD, and DSC. A favorable docking score was observed between luliconazole and Lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase. In-vitro cumulative drug release at the end of 24 h from E3-SS, containing sodium sulfide as a penetration enhancer, was found to be 94.70% and was 2 times more than the control formulation. Ex-vivo transungual permeation studies through cutting nail clippings were found to be in the range of 28.18 - 36.52 µg/mm<sup>2</sup>. The microemulgels tagged as E3, E3-SS, and E3-SL showed a significant zone of inhibition against Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus as compared to the marketed formulation.",2023,12,20
Understanding the role of infusing lubricant composition in the interfacial interactions and properties of slippery surface.,"Liquid-infused surfaces (LISs) have attracted tremendous attention in recent years owing to their excellent surface properties, such as self-cleaning and anti-fouling. Understanding the effect of lubricant composition on LIS performance is of vital importance, which will help establish the criteria to choose suitable infusing lubricants for specific applications. In this work, the role of chemical composition of lubricant in the properties of LISs was investigated. The apparent water contact angle θ<sub>app</sub> was dependent on the temperature and beeswax/silicone oil ratio. Nevertheless, the trend of moving velocity of water drop on the tilted LISs did not follow that of θ<sub>app</sub> at 20 °C and 37 °C, which was attributed to the increased lubricant viscosity with beeswax/silicone oil ratio. At 60 °C, the drop velocity and θ<sub>app</sub> shared the similar variation trend with beeswax/silicone oil ratio, highlighting the significant role of chemistry of the components in beeswax. The alkanes and fatty acids promoted the drop movement, while the fatty acid esters impeded the movement. The interaction forces between water drop and lubricant surfaces were measured using atomic force microscopy. It was demonstrated that the interaction between water drop and lubricant was not the only factor to control the drop movement, while the interaction between lubricant and substrate as well as of lubricant itself also determined the movement. When the adhesions of water-lubricant and lubricant-substrate were similar for different lubricants, the influence of cohesion of lubricant became significant. This work provides useful insights into the fundamental understanding of the interfacial interactions of test drop, infusing lubricant and solid substrate of LISs, and the effect of infusing lubricant composition on the LIS performance.",2023,12,30
Molecular modulating of amylopectin's structure promoted the formation of starch-unsaturated fatty acids complexes with controlled digestibility and improved stability to oxidation.,"In this study, waxy corn starch (WCS) was modified by amylosucrase and pullulanase, producing linear starch chains with elongated length that favored the complexation with unsaturated fatty acids (uFAs). Compared to native WCS, the amylosucrase-modified WCS with an average chain length of 47.8 was easier to form V-type complexes with oleic acid, while increasing the degree of unsaturation impeded the formation of V-type complexes. The pullulanase treatment hydrolyzed the branching points of amylosucrase-modified WCS and the linear starch chains could forme V-type complexes with oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid, with V-type crystallinity decreasing from 38.2 % to 20.1 %. V-type complexes had a lower thermal stability than the B-type starch crystallites, and their peak melting temperature ranged from 67.2 to 79.0 °C. The content of resistant starch in the complexes was in the range of 21.8 %-40.9 % and the formation of V-type complexes decreased the susceptibility of uFAs to oxygen.",2023,12,30

Apoptosis-driven synergistic anti-cancer efficacy of ethyl acetate extract of Memecylon sisparense Gamble leaves and doxorubicin in in-vitro and in-vivo models of triple-negative breast cancer.,"In the spectrum of breast neoplasms, approximately 15 to 20% of all diagnosed cases are triple-negative breast carcinoma. TNBC grows and spreads faster than other invasive breast cancers and has a worse prognosis. The existing therapies and chemotherapeutic drugs have several limitations, so the development of safe and affordable treatment options is currently in demand. Hence, this research focuses on scientifically evaluating the therapeutic anticancer effect of ethyl acetate extract of MSG and its combined efficacy with doxorubicin against TNBC. MSG has shown an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 48.40 ± 1.68 µg/ml on the MDA-MB-231 cell line, and the combination of MSG with Dox demonstrated the synergistic effect. Apoptotic changes such as membrane blebbing chromatin condensation were observed in MSG alone and in combination with doxorubicin treatments. Apoptosis was confirmed with Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and increased apoptotic markers such as Cleaved caspase-3 Bax and decreased anti-apoptotic markers Bcl-2 by western blotting. The tumor burden significantly decreased in MSG and combination treatment groups while restoring their body weights. Meanwhile, the Dox-treated group indicated a decreased tumor burden combined with weight loss. The present investigation revealed that MSG and doxorubicin have a synergistic anticancer effect in TNBC.",2023,12,18
An excellent bismuth-doped perovskite cathode with high activity and CO<sub>2</sub> resistance for solid-oxide fuel cells operating below 700 °C.,"Lowering the operating temperatures of solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is critical, although achieving success in this endeavor has proven challenging. Herein, Bi<sub>0.15</sub>Sr<sub>0.85</sub>Co<sub>0.8</sub>Fe<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>3-δ</sub> (BiSCF) is systematically evaluated as a carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)-tolerant and highly active cathode for SOFCs. BiSCF, which features Bi<sup>3+</sup> with an ionic radius similar to Ba<sup>2+</sup>, exhibits activity (e.g., 0.062 Ω cm<sup>2</sup> at 700 °C) comparable to that of Ba<sub>0.5</sub>Sr<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>0.8</sub>Fe<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>3-δ</sub> and PrBaCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5+δ</sub>, while demonstrating a considerable advantage over Bi-doped cathodes. Moreover, BiSCF exhibits long-term stability over a period of 500 h, and an anode-supported cell with BiSCF achieves a power density of 912 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> at 650 °C. The CO<sub>2</sub>-poisoned BiSCF exhibits quick reversibility or slight activation after returning to normal conditions. The exceptional CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance of BiSCF can be attributed to its reduced basicity and high electronegativity, which effectively restrict surface Sr diffusion and hinder subsequent carbonate formation. These findings highlight the substantial potential of BiSCF for SOFCs operating below 700 °C.",2023,12,30
Imbalance of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors induced by the deletion of CRMP1 accelerates age-related cognitive decline in mice.,"Collapsin response mediator protein 1 (CRMP1) is involved in semaphorin 3A signaling pathway, promoting neurite extension and growth cone collapse. It is highly expressed in the nervous system, especially the hippocampus. The crmp1 knockout (KO) mice display impaired spatial learning and memory, and this phenomenon seemingly tends to deteriorate with age. Here we investigated whether CRMP1 is involved in age-related cognitive decline in WT and crmp1 KO mice at adult, middle-aged and older stages. The results revealed that cognitive dysfunction in the Morris water maze task became more severe and decreased glutamate and glutamine level in middle-aged crmp1 KO mice. Additionally, increasing levels of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors and phosphorylation of Tau were observed in middle-aged crmp1 KO mice, leading to synaptic and neuronal loss in the CA3 regions of hippocampus. These findings suggest that deletion of CRMP1 accelerates age-related cognitive decline by disrupting the balance between synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, resulting in the loss of synapses and neurons.",2023,12,29
Mapping the profiles and underlying driving mechanisms of the antibiotic resistome and microbiome within a subtropical complex river watershed.,"Antibiotic resistance is an escalating global concern, leading to millions of annual deaths worldwide. Human activities can impact antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) prevalence in aquatic ecosystems, but the intricate interplay between anthropogenic disturbances and river system resilience, and their respective contributions to the dynamics of different river segments, remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the antibiotic resistome and microbiome in water and sediment samples from two distinct sub-watersheds within a specific watershed. Results show a decrease in the number of core ARGs downstream in water, while sediments near densely populated areas exhibit an increase. PCoA ordination reveals clear geographic clustering of resistome and microbiome among samples from strong anthropogenic disturbed areas, reservoir areas, and estuary area. Co-occurrence networks highlight a higher connectivity of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in disturbed areas compared to reservoir areas, presenting a threat to densely populated areas. Water quality parameters and antibiotics concentration were the key factors shaping the ARG profiles in sediment samples from urban regions. Overall, our study reveals distinct patterns of ARGs in sediment and water samples, emphasizing the importance of considering both anthropogenic and natural factors in comprehending and managing ARG distribution in river systems.",2023,12,29
Quadrivalent hemagglutinin and adhesion expressed on Saccharomyces cerevisiae induce protective immunity against Mycoplasma gallisepticum infection and improve gut microbiota.,"Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) infection causes infectious respiratory diseases in poultry, causing economic losses to the poultry industry. Therefore, this study aims to develop a safe, convenient, and effective multivalent recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae vaccine candidate and to explore its potential for oral immunization as a subunit vaccine. Mycoplasma gallisepticum Cytadhesin (MGC) and variable lipoprotein and hemagglutinin (vlhA) are associated with the pathogenesis of MG. In this study, a quadrivalent recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ST1814G-MG) displaying on MGC2, MGC3, VLH5, and VLH3, proteins was innovatively constructed, and its protective efficiency was evaluated in birds. The results showed that oral immunization with ST1814G-MG stimulates specific antibodies in chickens, reshapes the composition of the gut microbiota, reduces the Mycoplasma loading and pulmonary disease injury in the lungs. In addition, we found that oral ST1814G-MG had better protection against MG infection than an inactivated vaccine, and co-administration with the inactivated vaccine was even more effective. The results suggest that ST1814G-MG is a potentially safer and effective agent for controlling MG infection.",2023,12,31

In this study, modified Co-MoWTiO<sub>2</sub> catalysts with multiple active sites were synthesized using the wet impregnation method, which exhibited excellent multi-pollution control ability of NO, benzene and toluene under low oxygen and high SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The modification of Mo and Co achieved high dispersion and electron transfer. The interaction between W<sup>5+</sup>/W<sup>6+</sup> and Co<sup>2+</sup>/Co<sup>3+</sup> promoted gas-phase O<sub>2</sub> adsorption on the catalyst surface, forming of reactive oxygen species (O<sub>α</sub>).

The addition of graphene oxide significantly affected the abundance of denitrification genes such as Nap, Nos, and enhanced the contribution of Pseudomonas, making low temperature and material addition conducive to the denitrification process. Module network implied that low temperature increased the centrality of denitrification in community functions. At low temperatures, graphene oxide enhanced community anabolism by stimulation organic carbon consumption and regulating the gene abundance in the citric acid cycle and the semi-phosphorylation Entner-Doudoroff, thus possibly stimulating extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) synthesis and secretion. In addition, graphene oxide may also regulate the transfer of reducing electrons from NADH to denitrifying enzymes by affecting the gene abundances of complex I and complex IV.",2023,12,31

In a total of 6755 Rhipicephalus microplus DNA samples, Anaplasma marginale was the most detected with a frequency of 2% (Confidence Interval- CI 1.68-2.36), followed by Babesia bigemina with 0.28% (CI 0.16-0.44), Coxiella spp. with 0.15% (CI 0.07-0.27), and Rickettsia spp. with 0.13% (CI 0.06-0.25). Molecular analysis of the DNA sequences obtained from the tick samples revealed the presence of Coxiella-like endosymbiont and R. felis. These results demonstrated the diversity of microorganisms present in R. microplus ticks predominantly associated with cattle and questing ticks from livestock agroecosystems, suggesting their role as reservoirs and potential biological vectors of these microorganisms on the studied sites. Also, it emphasizes the need to combine acarological surveillance with clinical diagnoses and control strategies on regional and national levels.",2023,12,19
"""We are just not sure what that means or if it's relevant"": Uncertainty when gathering family history information in South African prenatal genetic counseling consultations.","Uncertainty impacts the process of health communication. The management and tolerance of uncertainty during healthcare discussions have gained renewed focus due to the growing challenge of obtaining and delivering complex health information, and the offer of health services in diverse contexts. Prenatal genetic counseling (GC) provides education, support and testing options for patients and couples facing a genetic or congenital diagnosis or risk during pregnancy. Gathering detailed and accurate family history information is essential to determine a patient's genetic risk. In South Africa, contextual factors such as patient literacy, language diversity, limited written patient health records, and a lack of familiarity with GC services may increase the potential for misunderstandings during GC consultations. This study uses a qualitative sociolinguistic approach to analyse 9 video-recorded South African prenatal GC consultations to understand the impact of uncertainty on the process of gathering family history information. The findings reveal uncertainty is introduced in different ways during family history taking. This includes when patients have no knowledge about their family history; when they have some knowledge but the details are unclear; or when patients have knowledge but the details are confusing. Uncertainty can lead to interactional trouble in the form of knowledge asymmetries, interrogative questioning, reversals in epistemic authority, and the potential for mistrust. Suggestions are made for how genetic specialists can manage uncertainty in GC family history taking. These include recognizing contextual sources of uncertainty, understanding how patients may respond to uncertainty and being aware of personal responses to moments of discomfort. Specific communication training recommendations and video-based sociolinguistic methods to enhance reflection and communication practice are highlighted. These approaches may enhance the effectiveness of GC communication and strengthen patient-specialist relationships, especially in diverse settings.",2023,12,29
"Efficacy of transcranial alternating current stimulation in treating chronic insomnia and the impact of age on its effectiveness: A multisite randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study.","Insomnia is a significant health issue associated with various systemic diseases. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been proposed as a potential intervention for insomnia. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of tACS in chronic insomnia remain unclear. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate the efficacy of tACS in treating chronic insomnia in adults and assess the impact of age on its effectiveness using a large sample from two centers.",2023,12,29
Advanced separation of mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons by number of aromatic rings using donor-acceptor-complex chromatography to extend on-line coupled liquid chromatography-gas chromatography.,"An automated implementation for a subfractionation of mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH) into a mono-/di-aromatic fraction (MDAF) and a tri-/poly-aromatic fraction (TPAF) is presented, which is highly demanded by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) respecting the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of MOAH. For this, donor-acceptor-complex chromatography (DACC) was used as a selective stationary phase to extend the conventional instrumental setup for the analysis of mineral oil hydrocarbons via on-line coupled liquid chromatography-gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (LC-GC-FID). A set of six new internal standards was introduced for the verification of the MOAH fractionation and a quantification of MDAF and TPAF, respectively. The automated DACC approach was applied to representative petrochemical references as well as to food samples, such as rice and infant formula, generally showing well conformity with results obtained by state-of-the-art analysis using two-dimensional GC (GCxGC). Relative deviations of DACC/LC-GC-FID compared to GCxGC-FID methods regarding the ≥ 3 ring MOAH content ranged between -50 and +6 % (median: -2 %, all samples, only values above limit of quantification). However, crucial deviations mainly result from ""border-crossing"" substances, e.g., dibenzothiophenes or partially hydrogenated MOAH. These substances can cause overestimations of ≥ 3 ring MOAH fraction during GCxGC analysis due to co-elution, which is mostly avoided using the DACC approach. Furthermore, the DACC approach can help to minimize underestimations of toxicologically relevant ≥ 3 ring MOAH caused by an unavoidable loss of MOAH during epoxidation, since natural olefins, such as terpenes, predominantly elute in MDAF, which was exemplarily shown for an olive oil and a terpene reference. The presented approach can be implemented easily in existing LC-GC-FID setup for an automated and advanced screening of MOAH to lower the need for elaborate GCxGC analysis also in routine environments.",2023,12,22
Aptamer-based flares hybridized with single-stranded DNA-conjugated MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets for ratiometric fluorescence sensing and imaging of potassium ions and adenosine triphosphate in human fluids and living cells.,"Addressing the limitations observed in previous studies, where the quantitative range of nanoprobes for detecting K<sup>+</sup> and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) did not cover concentrations found within living cells, the present study aimed to develop ratiometric nanoprobes that can accurately sense changes in K<sup>+</sup> and ATP levels in living cells and quantify them in human fluids. The proposed nanoprobes consisted of recognition flares modified with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA), along with thiolate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and molybdenum disulfide nanosheets (MoS<sub>2</sub> NSs). The thiolate ssDNA acts as a linker between the flares and the MoS<sub>2</sub> NSs, directly forming a functional nanostructure at room temperature. The direct conjugation of labeled flares to the MoS<sub>2</sub> NSs simplifies the fabrication process. In the absence of K<sup>+</sup> and ATP, the hybridization of flares and thiolate ssDNA caused FAM to move away from TAMRA, suppressing the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. However, upon the introduction of K<sup>+</sup> and ATP, the flares undergo a structural transformation via the formation of G-quadruplex formation and the generation of hairpin-shaped structures, respectively. This structural change leads to the release of the flares from the ssDNA-conjugated nanosheet surface. The release of the flares brings FAM and TAMRA into close proximity, allowing FRET to occur, leading to FRET and static quenching. By monitoring the ratio between the fluorescence intensities of FAM and TAMRA, the concentration of K<sup>+</sup> (5-100 mM) and ATP (0.3-5 mM) can be accurately determined by the proposed nanoprobes. The advantages of these nanoprobes lie in their ability to provide ratiometric measurements, which enhance the accuracy and reliability of the quantification process. The proposed nanoprobes offer potential applications as ratiometric imaging probes for monitoring K<sup>+</sup> and ATP-related reactions in living cells, providing valuable insights into cellular processes. Additionally, they can be employed for determining the levels of K<sup>+</sup> and ATP in human fluids, offering potential diagnostic applications in various clinical settings.",2023,12,22
"Novel insights into the co-metabolism of pyridine with different carbon substrates: Performance, metabolism pathway and microbial community.","Pyridine is a widely employed nitrogen-containing heterocyclic organic, and the discharge of pyridine wastewater poses substantial environmental challenges due to its recalcitrance and toxicity. Co-metabolic degradation emerged as a promising solution. In this study, readily degradable glucose and the structurally analogous phenol were used as co-metabolic substrates respectively, and the corresponding mechanisms were thoroughly explored. To treat 400 mg/L pyridine, all reactors achieved remarkably high removal efficiencies, surpassing 98.5%. And the co-metabolism reactors had much better pyridine-N removal performance. Batch experiments revealed that glucose supplementation bolstered nitrogen assimilation, thereby promoting the breakdown of pyridine, and resulting in the highest pyridine removal rate and pyridine-N removal efficiency. The high abundance of Saccharibacteria (15.54%) and the enrichment of GLU and glnA substantiated this finding. On the contrary, phenol delayed pyridine oxidation, potentially due to its higher affinity for phenol hydroxylase. Nevertheless, phenol proved valuable as a carbon source for denitrification, augmenting the elimination of pyridine-N. This was underscored by the abundant Thauera (30.77%) and Parcubacteria (7.21%) and the enriched denitrification enzymes (narH, narG, norB, norC, and nosZ, etc.). This study demonstrated that co-metabolic degradation can bolster the simultaneous conversion of pyridine and pyridine-N, and shed light on the underling mechanism.",2023,12,28
Chemical compositions and cryo-adhesive probing of the epicuticular wax crystals on fruit surface of wax gourd (Benincasa hispida).,"Surface wax crystals play important roles in protecting plants from pest and disease invasions, and UV irradiation. The wax crystals are less probed individually from the fruit surfaces. Herein the morphologies, chemicals and an efficient method to sample the wax blooms of white wax gourd were addressed. Various crystalloids such as rodlets, platelets, fragments, and granules were observed, which stacked as fine wax film covering on wax gourd fruit surface. The wax blooms were effectively removed by cryo-adhesive after consecutive manipulating set by a high-end device with cylinders. Wax crystals were dominated by triterpenols and triterpenol acetates over 61 % of total crystals, followed by vey-long-chain aliphatics. Accordingly, the high-end device with cryo-adhesive provides an efficient approach to selectively probe the wax crystals from those fruits covering wax blooms. The elucidation of morphologies and chemical compositions of wax crystals may help to better understand their regulations on fruit quality traits.",2023,12,30
A highly water-soluble hydrogen-bond-induced emission carbon dots for ratiometric fluorescent detection of water content in organic solvents.,"Water in organic solvents is a prevalent impurity that significantly influences chemical reactions and industrial processes. Carbon dots (CDs) gained attention as promising tools for chemosensing due to their advantageous characteristics, including easy synthesis, cost-effectiveness, and excellent adjustability and stability. However, limited solubility in water and turn off fluorescence response mode hinder the practical utilization of CDs for water sensing. To tackle such dilemma, a highly water-soluble CDs with distinctive hydrogen-bond-induced emission (HBIE) was rationally designed through introducing sulfone group into the widely employed p-phenylenediamine precursor. The inclusion of sulfone group imparts the CDs with notable water solubility, as well as distinctive ratiometric fluorescent response towards water content, exhibiting high sensitivity and selectivity. Upon exposure to water, the emission color of CDs undergoes a real-time transition from blue to yellow-green, which can be readily discerned by naked eyes. The CDs have been successfully applied in detecting water in commercially available alcohol. This study presents a straightforward yet efficacious approach for rationally design of CDs with unique HBIE characteristics and ratiometric fluorescent response, offering great potential for practical chemosensing applications.",2023,12,22
"RNA four-way junction (4WJ) for spontaneous cancer-targeting, effective tumor-regression, metastasis suppression, fast renal excretion and undetectable toxicity.","The field of RNA therapeutics has been emerging as the third milestone in pharmaceutical drug development. RNA nanoparticles have displayed motile and deformable properties to allow for high tumor accumulation with undetectable healthy organ accumulation. Therefore, RNA nanoparticles have the potential to serve as potent drug delivery vehicles with strong anti-cancer responses. Herein, we report the physicochemical basis for the rational design of a branched RNA four-way junction (4WJ) nanoparticle that results in advantageous high-thermostability and -drug payload for cancer therapy, including metastatic tumors in the lung. The 4WJ nanostructure displayed versatility through functionalization with an anti-cancer chemical drug, SN38, for the treatment of two different cancer models including colorectal cancer xenograft and orthotopic lung metastases of colon cancer. The resulting 4WJ RNA drug complex spontaneously targeted cancers effectively for cancer inhibition with and without ligands. The 4WJ displayed fast renal excretion, rapid body clearance, and little organ accumulation with undetectable toxicity and immunogenicity. The safety parameters were documented by organ histology, blood biochemistry, and pathological analysis. The highly efficient cancer inhibition, undetectable drug toxicity, and favorable Chemical, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) production of RNA nanoparticles document a candidate with high potential for translation in cancer therapy.",2023,12,21
Impact of long-acting injectable antipsychotics vs. oral medication on relapses of patients with psychosis and bipolar disorder.,"Relapse associated with multiple hospital readmissions of patients with chronic and severe mental disorders, such as psychosis and bipolar disorder, is frequently associated with non-adherence to treatment. The primary aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of long-acting injectable (LAI) treatment, vs. oral medication in reducing readmissions of patients with psychotic or bipolar disorder in a community sample of 164 patients with psychosis and 29 patients with bipolar disorder (n = 193), with poor adherence to oral medication. The mean follow up period was 5.6 years and the number of readmissions were compared for an equal-length period of oral treatment preceding the onset of LAI administration. We observed a significant decrease of 45.2 % in total hospital readmissions after receiving LAIs treatment. The effect was significant both for patients with a pre-LAI treatment history of predominantly voluntary hospitalizations and with predominantly involuntary admissions. In addition, we observed equal effectiveness of first- vs. second-generation LAIs in reducing total hospital readmissions regardless of type of pre-treatment admission history (voluntary vs. involuntary). LAIs appear to be effective in reducing both voluntary and involuntary hospital readmissions in patients with psychosis and bipolar disorder with a history of poor adherence to treatment.",2023,12,24
The highly selective rhodol-based putrescine probe and visual sensors for on-site detection of putrescine in food spoilage.,"Putrescine (Butane-1,4-diamine) has been regarded as a vital marker of spoiling protein-rich foods, especially meat and seafood. The detection of putrescine in food is considered a convenient and powerful method for evaluating the degree of spoilage of protein-rich foods. Herein, a novel rhodol-based fluorescent probe RSMA (formyl-rhodol Schiff base with methoxyaniline) was developed to detect putrescine. RSMA exhibited excellent linearity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9912) in the concentration range of 0-45 μM of putrescine with a detection limit as low as 0.45 μM. Although RSMA had moderate responses to some aliphatic diamines, the selectivity of RSMA for putrescine was one of the best reported in the literature so far. Moreover, RSMA was successfully fabricated to solid-state sensors for on-site detection of putrescine in shrimp, that demonstrated its application in monitoring food spoilage.",2023,12,28
Synergistic effects of CuS/TiO<sub>2</sub> heterointerfaces: Enhanced cathodic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction and anodic CH<sub>3</sub>OH oxidation for paired electrosynthesis of formate.,"The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide into energy-carrying compounds or value-added chemicals is of great significance for diminishing the greenhouse effect. However, it is still imperative to replace the less-value anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to improve the technical economy. Herein, we firstly reported a bifunctional CuS/TiO<sub>2</sub> catalyst for both anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and cathodic carbon dioxide reduction (CO<sub>2</sub>R). The in-built abundant CuS/TiO<sub>2</sub> heterointerfaces are found to boost the CO<sub>2</sub>R and MOR to produce formate. Based on the unique bifunctionality of CuS/TiO<sub>2</sub>, a paired electrosynthesis of formate was performed with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of about 170 %, in which the cathodic CO<sub>2</sub>R achieved a formate FE of about 70 %, and the anodic MOR exhibited an almost 100 % formate FE.",2023,12,30
The effect of octenyl succinic anhydride-modified chitosan coating on DHA-loaded nanoemulsions: Physichemical stability and in vitro digestibility.,"Octenyl succinic anhydride-modified chitosan (OSA-CS) was synthesized and applied as a coating material to enhance the stability of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-loaded nanoemulsion. Due to the presence of the positively charged OSA-CS coating, the nanoemulsion exhibited a high positive zeta potential and two different layers. Compared with natural CS-coated nanoemulsion, OSA-CS-coated nanoemulsion showed improved storage stability (physical and chemical stability) and stability against environmental stresses (ionic strengths, temperatures and pH). Besides, OSA-CS-coated nanoemulsion protected encapsulated DHA from simulated gastric fluid damage better than that of natural CS-coated nanoemulsion, suggesting that OSA-CS-coated nanoemulsion had the potential to deliver more DHA into the small intestine. In conclusion, based on the comparison of two coating materials, natural chitosan and OSA-CS, it was found that the encapsulated nutrient was better protected by the OSA-CS coating. Such a finding will provide insights to broaden the application of modified chitosan in food delivery systems.",2023,12,29
Association between sleep pattern and incidence of hypertension: A prospective cohort study of older adult participants in the Chinese longitudinal healthy longevity survey.,"The relationship between sleep duration or sleep quality and the risk of hypertension has been previously examined.

"Effects of dietary methionine supplementation on the growth performance, immune responses, antioxidant capacity, and subsequent development of layer chicks.","Deficiencies or excesses of dietary amino acids, and especially of methionine (Met), in laying hens can lead to abnormal protein anabolism and oxidative stress, which affect methylation and cause cellular dysfunction. This study investigated the effects of dietary methionine (Met) levels on growth performance, metabolism, immune response, antioxidant capacity, and the subsequent development of laying hens. A total of 384 healthy 1-day-old Hyline Grey chicks of similar body weight were randomly allocated to be fed diets containing 0.31%, 0.38%, 0.43% (control group), or 0.54% Met for 6 wk, with 6 replicates of 16 chicks in each. The growth performance of the chicks was then followed until 20 wk old. The results showed dietary supplementation with 0.43% or 0.54% Met significantly increased their mean daily body weight gain, final weight, and Met intake. However, the feed:gain (F/G) decreased linearly with increasing Met supplementation, from 0.31 to 0.54% Met. Met supplementation increased the serum albumin, IgM, and total glutathione concentrations of 14-day-old chicks. In contrast, the serum alkaline phosphatase activity and hydroxyl radical concentration tended to decrease with increasing Met supplementation. In addition, the highest serum concentrations of IL-10, T-SOD, and GSH-PX were in the 0.54% Met-fed group. At 42 d of age, the serum ALB, IL-10, T-SOD, GSH-PX, T-AOC, and T-GSH were correlated with dietary Met levels. Finally, Met supplementation reduced the serum concentrations of ALP, IL-1β, IgA, IgG, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals. Thus, the inclusion of 0.43% or 0.54% Met in the diet helps chicks achieve superior performance during the brooding period and subsequently. In conclusion, Met doses of 0.43 to 0.54% could enhance the growth performance, protein utilization efficiency, antioxidant capacity, and immune responses of layer chicks, and to promote more desirable subsequent development during the brooding period.",2023,12,18
[Effect of a novel pH-responsive tertiary amine monomer dodecylmethylaminoethyl methacrylate modified resin adhesive on biofilm formation of <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> and <i>Lactobacillus casei</i> <i>in vitro</i>].,"<b>Objective:</b> To explore the application prospect of a new pH-responsive tertiary amine monomer dodecylmethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEM) modified resin adhesive (DMAEM@RA) in the prevention and treatment of secondary caries. <b>Methods:</b> Five percents DMAEM was added to the resin adhesive to synthesize DMAEM@RA for modifying. <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> (Sm) and <i>Lactobacillus casei</i> (Lc) biofilms were cultured on resin adhesive and 5% DMAEM@RA, respectively. The culture systems were set up at pH=7.4, 6.0, 5.5, and 5.0. The antimicrobial activity of DMAEM@RA was evaluated by quantitative PCR. The effects of DMAEM@RA on biofilm thickness, bacterial amount, and extracellular polysaccharides were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and extracellular polysaccharide staining. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to study the effect of DMAEM@RA on the expression levels of cariogenic genes in Sm. <b>Results:</b> DMAEM@RA could significantly reduce the amount of Sm and Lc under acidic conditions, especially Lc. The logarithmic value of co-cultured Sm decreased significantly from 7.87±0.03 to 7.58±0.01 (<i>t=</i>14.32, <i>P<</i>0.001), while the co-culture Lc decreased from 7.93±0.15 to 7.29±0.04 (<i>t=</i>6.93, <i>P=</i>0.002). SEM observed that the bacteria decreased and the cell fragments appeared after DMAEM treatment. In addition, DMAEM@RA significantly reduced the extracellular polysaccharides in the dual-species biofilm under acidic conditions, from (42.66±7.46) μm<sup>3</sup>/μm<sup>3</sup> to (25.13±3.14) μm<sup>3</sup>/μm<sup>2</sup> at pH=5.0 (<i>t=</i>3.75, <i>P=</i>0.020). DMAEM@RA could significantly up-regulate the expressions of gtfB and gtfC genes in Sm under acidic conditions. At pH=5.0, gtfB and gtfC genes were significantly up-regulated by (14.64±0.44) times and (2.99±0.20) times(t=-42.74，P<0.001;t=-13.55, P<0.001), respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> The DMAEM modified resin adhesive has a good antibacterial effect under acidic conditions, demonstrating that it has a good potential to prevent the occurrence and development of secondary caries.",2023,12,29
"Impacts of willow (Salix babylonica L.) leaf extract on growth, cecal microbial population, and blood biochemical parameters of broilers.","The investigation examined the use of willow leaf extract (WLE) on broiler chickens, examining carcass characteristics, cecal microbiota, antioxidants, and blood parameters. In 4 groups of 300 chicks, a basal diet was given for 5 wk, and the first treatment was basal diet (C). The diets for the remaining 3 treatments (WLE150, WLE300, and WLE450) contained 150, 300, and 450 mg of willow leaf extract /kg, respectively. The study found that birds fed willow leaf extract supplements had significantly greater body weight (BW), body weight gain (BWG), and enhanced feed conversion ratio (FCR) vs. the control group. Birds fed at 450 mg/kg food showed the greatest growth features, carcass weight, liver weight, lower abdominal fat, better low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations, and highest hematological characteristics. Chickens fed diets supplemented with varied doses of willow leaf extract showed significantly increased antioxidant enzyme activity, with higher amounts of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and lower malondialdehyde (MDA). However, in the study, birds fed a diet supplemented with 450 mg of willow leaf extract per kg meal showed a significant drop of 13.02%, which found no significant variations in hazardous bacteria (Escherichia coli) across 2 treatments (WLE150 and WLE300). In addition, the study discovered that birds fed with varied doses of willow leaf extract had fewer cecum infections (Staphylococci aureus). We conclude that using willow at a level of 450 mg/kg diet can significantly enhance the BWG, FCR, antioxidant levels and beneficial bacteria activity besides the condition of broiler chicken's general health.",2023,12,16
Effect of ionic liquids as mobile phase additives on retention behaviors of G-quadruplexes in reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography.,"G-quadruplexes (G4s) play an important role in a variety of biological processes and have extensive application prospects. Due to the significance of G4s in physiology and biosensing, studies on G4s have attracted much attention, stimulating the development or improvement of methods for G4 structures and polymorphism analysis. In this work, ionic liquids (ILs) were involved as mobile phase additives in reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) to analyse G4s with various conformations for the first time. How ILs affected the retention behaviors of G4s was investigated comprehensively. It was found that the addition of ILs markedly enhanced G4 retention, along with obvious amelioration on chromatographic peak shapes and separation. The influence of pH of mobile phase and types of ILs were also included in order to acquire an in-depth understanding. It appeared that the effect of ILs on G4 retention behaviors was the result of a combination of various interactions between G4s with the hydrophobic stationary phase and with the IL-containing mobile phase, where ion pair mechanism and enhanced hydrophobic interaction dominated. The findings of this work revealed that ILs could effectively improve the separation of G4s in RP-HPLC, which was conducive to G4 structural analysis, especially for G4s polymorphism elucidation.",2023,12,28
Surgical management of pseudotumor cerebri syndrome: A single center experience with endoscopic optic nerve decompression and CSF diversion procedures.,"Pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTC) is a chronic disorder, which is initially treated by conservative measures, yet surgery is inevitable in case of progressive worsening of vision or headache despite medical treatment. The surgical management is controversial including CSF diversion procedures and optic decompression.

Self-determined sequence exercise program for elderly with sarcopenia: A Randomized controlled trial with clinical assistance from explainable artificial intelligence.,"To improve and even reverse sarcopenia in elderly people, this study developed a self-determined sequence exercise program consisting of strength training exercise, Yijinjing exercise (a traditional Chinese exercise), and hybrid strength training with Yijinjing exercise. Ninety-four community-dwelling older adults screened for sarcopenia using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria were randomly assigned to 24 weeks of a control group (CG, n = 30), self-determined sequence exercise program group (SDSG, n = 34) or strength training group (STG, n = 30). The study examined the effects of three interventions on participantsL3 skeletal muscle fat density, L3 skeletal muscle fat area, L3 skeletal muscle density, L3 skeletal muscle area, muscle fat infiltration, relative skeletal muscle mass index, and grip strength using a repeated-measures ANOVA to evaluate the experimental data. To evaluate the real effect of this model in reversing sarcopenia after the intervention, nine classification models were trained. Significant interaction effects were observed with grip strength, RSMI, L3 SMD, and L3 SMA. At the 24th week, participants' grip strength, L3 SMFA, L3 SMA, and RSMI were improved significantly in the SDSG and STG. The SDSG achieved significantly greater RSMI and grip strength than the STG and CG after the intervention. The self-determined sequence exercise program exhibited better performance than the single type of exercise modality in reversing sarcopenia and improving older adults' skeletal muscle area. Consequently, the stacking model is feasible to make a prediction as to whether or not sarcopenia may be reversed in older adults.",2023,12,21
Development of a fluorometric Cuboni test for the semi-quantitative measurement of urinary estrogen levels and pregnancy detection in mares.,"The aim of the present study was to develop a semi-quantitative urine pregnancy test for mares based on the Cuboni reaction and to verify the reliability of this test. The urine specimens were hydrolyzed by heating in the presence of hydrochloric acid. The resulting free estrogen were extracted from the urine matrix using toluene. Sulfuric acid was added to the toluene extract and the mixture was heated again. The lower layer in the test tube containing sulfuric acid was used for fluorescence measurements with excitation at 355 nm and measurement at 535 nm. The fluorometric Cuboni test revealed that the fluorescence counts in urine samples collected after the second trimester of gestation were significantly higher than those obtained from barren mares. The levels of estrogens, including equilin, estrone and estardiol-17β exhibited a dose-dependent increase in fluorescence counts, whereas other steroids, such as progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol, did not affect fluorescence. Heat treatment of urine samples with hydrochloric acid significantly increased the fluorescence counts in those collected after the second trimester of gestation compared to non-pregnant samples, implying the presence of large amounts of conjugated estrogens in pregnant mare urine. Fluorescence counts in urine samples obtained during pregnancy showed a positive relationship with estrone concentrations as measured by enzyme immunoassay. The results of the present study showed that the fluorometric Cuboni test facilitates urine fluorescence counts depending on the urinary estrogen content and is capable of discriminating between pregnancy and non-pregnancy states beyond the second trimester of gestation in mares.",2023,12,29
Turning brain MRI into diagnostic PET: <sup>15</sup>O-water PET CBF synthesis from multi-contrast MRI via attention-based encoder-decoder networks.,"Accurate quantification of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is essential for the diagnosis and assessment of a wide range of neurological diseases. Positron emission tomography (PET) with radiolabeled water (<sup>15</sup>O-water) is the gold-standard for the measurement of CBF in humans, however, it is not widely available due to its prohibitive costs and the use of short-lived radiopharmaceutical tracers that require onsite cyclotron production. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in contrast, is more accessible and does not involve ionizing radiation. This study presents a convolutional encoder-decoder network with attention mechanisms to predict the gold-standard <sup>15</sup>O-water PET CBF from multi-contrast MRI scans, thus eliminating the need for radioactive tracers. The model was trained and validated using 5-fold cross-validation in a group of 126 subjects consisting of healthy controls and cerebrovascular disease patients, all of whom underwent simultaneous <sup>15</sup>O-water PET/MRI. The results demonstrate that the model can successfully synthesize high-quality PET CBF measurements (with an average SSIM of 0.924 and PSNR of 38.8 dB) and is more accurate compared to concurrent and previous PET synthesis methods. We also demonstrate the clinical significance of the proposed algorithm by evaluating the agreement for identifying the vascular territories with impaired CBF. Such methods may enable more widespread and accurate CBF evaluation in larger cohorts who cannot undergo PET imaging due to radiation concerns, lack of access, or logistic challenges.",2023,12,29
Tracing sediment sources in a plain river network area by using optimized experimental design and reflectance spectroscopy.,"Soil erosion in a plain river network area with dense rivers, fertile land, and agricultural development is easily causes river siltation, agricultural non-point source pollution, and water eutrophication. Therefore, the negative impact of the sediment on the environment cannot be underestimated. Most traditional sediment fingerprint tracing studies have focused on mountain basins and lack a scheme suitable for plain river network sediment tracing. Here, a typical plain river network in the Taihu Basin was selected as the study area. The flow structure and characteristics were analysed, and a sampling scheme for the stream segment and a two-step model of sediment tracing in a plain river network were proposed to quantitatively distinguish the types of sediment sources. The results indicated that the traditional discriminant function analysis adequately distinguishes the contribution rate of basin soil and has a good validation accuracy (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.96, root mean square error of calibration = 5.91 %), whereas Random Forest obtains better discrimination results by mining non-linear information in the soil spectra of different land types, with R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.89, 0.83, and 0.80 for farmland, forest, and grassland, respectively. The average proportion of soil in the sediment in the watershed was 23 %, and the proportion of soil in the watershed increased from upstream to downstream. The sediment sources of the Caoqiao, Yincun, and Shaoxiang Rivers mainly came from grassland (44 %), forest (39 %), and farmland (42 %), respectively. Land-use distribution, water conservation facilities, and soil particle size were the main factors affecting these sources. Each river adopts measures to remove the corresponding pollutants, optimise water and soil conservation measures for riverbank green belts and forest, and regularly clean up silt in water conservancy ditches and rivers, which can reduce the pollution impact caused by sediment.",2023,12,19

We report a case of TB diagnose by metagenomic next-generation sequencing(mNGS) who presented with clinical criteria of AOSD and extreme hyperferritinemia, which posed a diagnostic confusion. TB presenting with major clinical criteria of AOSD should be notable. Since TB remains a potentially curable disease, an awareness of its' protean manifestations is essential.

For equivocal cases, mNGS could be helpful.",2023,12,27
Response of broiler breeder pullets when fed hydrolyzed whole yeast from placement to 22 wk of age.,"The study examined the effects of feeding broiler breeder pullets hydrolyzed whole yeast (HY) from hatch to 22 wk of age (WOA). A total of 524-day-old Ross 708 pullets were placed in floor pens (∼24 birds/pen) for the starter (0-4 WOA) and grower (5-18 WOA) phases, then transferred to the egg production facility and redistributed to ∼20 birds/pen for the prelay phase (19-22 WOA). Two diets were allocated to pens (0-18 WOA; n = 11) and (19-22 WOA; n-12). The diets were a control corn and soybean meal diet formulated to meet specifications and control plus 0.05% HY (HY). Birds had ad libitum access to feed in the first week and daily feed allocation based on pen BW from 2 WOA. Birds had free access to water throughout the trial. Body weight (BW) and uniformity (BW CV) were monitored. Boosters for infectious bronchitis and New Castle disease vaccines were administered at 18 WOA, and samples of pullets bled for antibody titer 5-day later. One pullet/pen was randomly selected, weighed, bled for plasma biochemistry, and necropsied for organ weights, ceca digesta for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and leg bones morphometry. In the starter and grower phases, birds fed HY were lighter and gained less (P < 0.05) than control birds. However, there were no diet effects (P > 0.05) on growth, the BW prelay phase, or BW uniformity throughout the trial. There were no (P > 0.05) diet effects on breast, gastrointestinal, liver and bursa weights, serum antibody titers, plasma biochemistry, SCFA and bone attributes. However, pullets fed HY had heavier (P = 0.047) spleen and tended to have lower (P = 0.080) plasma concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) relative to control pullets. In conclusion, the parameters assessed showed no negative consequences of feeding HY to broiler breeder pullets. However, effects on the spleen and plasma AST may indicate modest modulation of immunity and metabolism. The impact of the provision of HY during broiler breeder pullet phase on reproductive performance and chick quality should be investigated.",2023,12,18
Personality traits as predictors for treatment response to sertraline among unmedicated obsessive-compulsive Disorder: A 12-weeks retrospective longitudinal study.,"The effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as a primary treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) remains uncertain. Even after undergoing standard SSRIs treatment, 40%-60% of individuals with OCD persistently endure symptoms. Recent studies proposed that personality traits may influence the diversity of OCD treatment results. Thus, in this retrospective study, we evaluated the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) scores of 51 untreated patients with OCD and 35 healthy controls. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was employed to assess OCD symptom severity at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 of sertraline treatment. The primary outcome focused on the reduction rate of Y-BOCS scores (response: ≥25%; marked response: ≥50%). Our findings revealed that individuals with OCD demonstrated a significantly higher neuroticism score compared to healthy controls. Correlation analyses exposed a positive link between psychoticism and the duration of the disease. Moreover, family history strongly correlated with both obsessive thoughts and the total Y-BOCS score. Subsequent univariate Cox proportional analyses indicated that both low neuroticism and high extraversion traits could forecast the response to sertraline. Furthermore, only a high extraversion trait was linked to a marked response. Our results support the idea that personality traits may contribute to OCD vulnerability and predict sertraline treatment outcomes.",2023,12,18
An eco-friendly versatile superabsorbent hydrogel based on sodium alginate and urea for soil improvement with a synchronous chemical loading strategy.,"In this paper, an eco-friendly versatile superabsorbent material was designed for soil improvement, and a synchronous chemical loading strategy was proposed. In this strategy, urea not only acted as fertilizer but also acted as a crosslinker to construct an alginate network. The microstructure, chemical structure, thermal stability and composition of the obtained SA/urea hydrogel were characterized in detail. Adsorption behavior and application performance in agriculture were evaluated. The results demonstrated that urea had two different conformations in the network. The SA/urea hydrogel had abundant pore structures with excellent water absorption performance. It could not only improve the water retention capacity of soil but also release nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium elements with degradation for as long as 9 weeks. Moreover, the hydrogel could promote plant growth, increase the nutritional composition of plants and inhibit the accumulation of harmful nitrate in plants. With advantages, including biodegradability, high water absorption, controllable degradation, excellent water retention, sustained NPK release and improved plant nutrition value, the SA/urea hydrogel has great potential for soil improvement in agriculture as an eco-friendly versatile water retention agent and can be expected to extend to more fields as a novel superabsorbent material.",2023,12,12
Nanocellulose hydrogels formed via crystalline transformation from cellulose I to II and subsequent freeze cross-linking reaction.,"We describe nanocellulose (NC) hydrogels formed from chemically unmodified NC by cellulose crystalline transformation and subsequent freeze cross-linking reaction. The freeze cross-linked NC hydrogel with macropores (~100 μm) was prepared by freezing a mixture of NC and NaOH (0.2 mol L<sup>-1</sup>), adding citric acid to the frozen mixture, and thawing it. Using NaOH and freezing together induced the crystalline transformation of NC from cellulose I to II via freeze concentration. After the crystalline transformation, cross-linking between the NC and CA in the freeze concentration layer provided a strong NC network structure, forming NC hydrogels with high mechanical strength. The structural changes in NC caused by NaOH, freezing, and freeze cross-linking on the angstrom to micrometer scale were investigated with FT-IR, SAXS, PXRD, and SEM. The freeze cross-linked NC hydrogel easily retained powder adsorbents in its inner space by mixing the NC-NaOH sol and the powder, and the hydrogel showed high removal efficiency for heavy metals. The results highlight the versatility of chemically unmodified celluloses in developing functional materials and suggest possible practical applications. This study also provides new insights into the efficient use of chemical reactions of cellulose under freezing conditions.",2023,12,01
Cellulose-based bi-layer hydrogel evaporator with a low evaporation enthalpy for efficient solar desalination.,"Interfacial evaporation through hydrogel-based evaporators is emerging as a sustainable and cost-effective strategy for drinkable water production. Herein, a specially designed bi-layer hydrogel evaporator was fabricated and used for efficient solar water desalination. With cotton linter as cellulose precursor, it was dispersed in a highly concentrated ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (65 %) solution, and cross-linked by epichlorohydrin to prepare cellulose composite hydrogel. After removing inorganic salts by salt-leaching, polyaniline (PANi) with broadband and wide-range light absorption was then integrated into the top surface of hydrogel through in situ polymerization to construct a bi-layer evaporator. As a solar evaporator, the water could be evaporated with a low-energy demand, and the heat from the sunlight could be confined at the interface to achieve efficient water evaporation. Therefore, the hydrogel evaporator demonstrates an optimal water evaporation rate of 3.02 kg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> and photothermal conversion efficiency of 89.09 % under 1 sun (1 kW m<sup>-2</sup>) irradiation. This work provides new possibilities for efficient solar water purification systems with assured water quality.",2023,12,15
Hydrochromic film for dynamic information storage using cellulose nanofibers and silica nanoparticles.,"A hydrochromic composite film was fabricated by incorporating silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) with cellulose nanofibers (CNFs). The CNF/SiNP composite film underwent a reversible change in transparency in response to external moisture variation. The CNFs improved the dimensional stability of the CNF/SiNP composite film and induced morphological differences in SiNP agglomerates, which control the water vapor condensation in a porous film. The condensed water in the pores reduced the difference in refractive index over the CNF/SiNP film, enhancing its transparency. The selective transparency of the composite film was challenged by printing CNF/SiNP inks at different composition ratios. The differing susceptibility of the printed patterns to moisture provided selective transparency at specific patterns, which can store dynamic information such as QR or numerical codes by simple water vapor adsorption and desorption.",2023,12,14
Nanocellulose based ultra-elastic and durable foams for smart packaging applications.,"Foams with advanced sensing properties and excellent mechanical properties are promising candidates for smart packaging materials. However, the fabrication of ultra-elastic and durable foams is still challenging. Herein, we report a universal strategy to obtain ultra-elastic and durable foams by crosslinking cellulose nanofiber and MXene via strong covalent bonds and assembling the composites into anisotropic cellular structures. The obtained composite foam shows an excellent compressive strain of up to 90 % with height retention of 97.1 % and retains around 90.3 % of its original height even after 100,000 compressive cycles at 80 % strain. Their cushioning properties were systematically investigated, which are superior to that of wildly-used petroleum-based expanded polyethylene and expanded polystyrene. By employing the foam in a piezoelectric sensor, a smart cushioning packaging and pressure monitoring system is constructed to protect inner precision cargo and detect endured pressure during transportation for the first time.",2023,12,13
Micro- and nano-hybrid cellulose fibers prepared by straightforward and high-efficiency hot water soaking-assisted colloid grinding for high-performance cellulose paper.,"Micro- and nano-hybrid cellulose fiber (MNCF) stands out as a versatile cellulosic nanomaterial with promising applications in various fields owing to its excellent intrinsic nature and outstanding characteristics. However, the inefficiency in preparing MNCF, attributed to a complex multi-step processing, hinders its widespread adoption. In this study, a straightforward and highly efficient method for MNCF preparation was developed via a hot water soaking-assisted colloid grinding strategy. Active water molecules in hot water facilitating stronger transverse shrinkage and longitudinal expansion in fiber crystallized region, and thus improving the fibrillation degree of cellulose fibers. As a result, MNCFs with a mean diameter of 37.5 ± 22.2 nm and high concentration (2 wt%) were successfully achieved though pure mechanical method. The micro and nano-hybrid structure leads to the corresponding resulting cellulose paper with micro- and nano-hybrid structure possesses a compact stacking and fewer defects, leading to extraordinary mechanical properties including tensile strength of 204.5 MPa, Young's modulus of 6.3 GPa and elongation of 10.1 %. This work achieves significant progress towards straightforward and highly efficient production of MNCFs, offering an appreciable prospect for the development of multifunctional MNCF-based materials.",2023,12,11
Mechanochemically functionalized and fibrillated microcrystalline cellulose as a filler in silicone foam: An integrated experimental and simulation investigation.,"Fibrillated celluloses have gained significant attention due to their exceptional mechanical properties and eco-friendly characteristics, which make them suitable for various applications. In this study, we designed a precise approach for producing highly fibrillated microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) via ball-milling treatment using four typical silane coupling agents. The empirical data demonstrate that the fibrillization of MCC and the properties of fibrillated MCC are largely affected by the size and geometry of the functional groups of the silanes. After ball-milling, most MCC displayed enhanced e-beam tolerance and thermal stability, whereas the silane loading amount, surface area, and morphology of fibrillated MCC appeared to be random, which was exemplified by the proportional and non-proportional relationship between the loading amount and surface area of methyl silane- and phenyl silane-treated MCC, respectively. Density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to obtain the intricate details. The simulation results were in agreement with the experimental results. Finally, fibrillated MCC was incorporated into silicone foams as an additive. The thermal stability of fibrillated MCC with added silicone was greatly improved, and the tensile strength of fibrillated MCC-containing silicone foam was 44.1 and 5.4 times higher than that of the neat and MCC-containing silicone foams, respectively.",2023,12,11
"Molecular self-assembled cellulose enabling durable, scalable, high-power osmotic energy harvesting.","In recent years, renewable cellulose-based ion exchange membranes have emerged as promising candidates for capturing green, abundant osmotic energy. However, the low power density and structural/performance instability are challenging for such cellulose membranes. Herein, cellulose-molecule self-assembly engineering (CMA) is developed to construct environmentally friendly, durable, scalable cellulose membranes (CMA membranes). Such a strategy enables CMA membranes with ideal nanochannels (∼7 nm) and tailored channel lengths, which support excellent ion selectivity and ion fluxes toward high-performance osmotic energy harvesting. Finite element simulations also verified the function of tailored nanochannel length on osmotic energy conversion. Correspondingly, our CMA membrane shows a high-power density of 2.27 W/m<sup>2</sup> at a 50-fold KCl gradient and super high voltage of 1.32 V with 30-pair CMA membranes (testing area of 22.2 cm<sup>2</sup>). In addition, the CMA membrane demonstrates long-term structural and dimensional integrity in saline solution, due to their high wet strength (4.2 MPa for N-CMA membrane and 0.5 MPa for P-CMA membrane), and correspondingly generates ultrastable yet high power density more than 100 days. The self-assembly engineering of cellulose molecules constructs high-performance ion-selective membranes with environmentally friendly, scalable, high wet strength and stability advantages, which guide sustainable nanofluidic applications beyond the blue energy.",2023,12,05
Nanomagnetic Cyclodextrin decorated with ionic liquid as green and reversible Demulsifier for breaking of crude oil emulsions.,"Application of the chemical demulsifiers is the best choice for breaking the water in crude oil (W/O) emulsions in the petroleum industry. Here, novel, environmentally friendly, efficient, and easily reusable Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanomagnetic compounds based on imidazolium-decorated cyclodextrin were successfully synthesized and applied to demulsify the water in crude oil (W/O) emulsions. At first, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles were decorated with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) to prepare Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@β-CD@IL magnetic nanoparticles. Then, imidazole (Im) was separately reacted with 1-bromohexane and 1-bromodecane to prepare [Im-C6][Br] and [Im-C10][Br] ionic liquids, respectively. The prepared imidazolium-based ionic liquids were reacted with N-propyltriethoxysilane to synthesize [ImSi-C6][Br] and [ImSi-C10][Br]. Finally, [ImSi-Cn][Br] was immobilized on Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@β-CD to obtain nanomagnetic demulsifiers. Structure of the synthesized compounds was confirmed using different methods such as FT-IR, NMR, and elemental analysis. TGA, VSM, and FESEM methods were used to investigate the thermal stability, magnetic properties, and the morphology, respectively. Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@βCD and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@βCD@[ImSi-C10][Br] nanoparticles respectively showed the particle size in the range of 40-70 nm and 50-80 nm. After grafting the imidazolium-based ionic liquid on the surface of support, the magnetization number reduced from 25.6 emu/g for Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@β-CD to 24.9 emu/g for Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@β-CD@[ImSi-C10][Br]. Synthesized material employed to break the (10:90 and 30:70 Vol%) W/O emulsions at the concentration range of 1000-5000 ppm. The maximum demulsification efficiency (DE%) of 92 % was obtained using a Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@β-CD@[ImSi-C10][Br] at 5000 ppm for (30:70 Vol%) W/O emulsion within 24 h. Interfacial tension (IFT) values decreased with increasing the DE%. The Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@βCD@[ImSi-C10][Br] demulsifier was reused five times with acceptable yields. The cooperation of imidazolium and β-CD in the green nanomagnetic demulsifiers led to the efficient demulsification of the W/O emulsions. The preparation of different ionic liquids or changing the counter anions are our potential future directions for this research. Demulsification at high demulsifier concentration can be considered a limitation of the nanomagnetic cyclodextrin decorated with ionic liquid. But due to the low amount of ionic liquid immobilized in the synthesized demulsifier, the cost of the final demulsifier is lower that other demulsifiers with full ionic liquid backbones, which increases its potential for industrial applications.",2023,12,17
Demystifying AI: Current State and Future Role in Medical Education Assessment.,"Medical education assessment faces multifaceted challenges, including data complexity, resource constraints, bias, feedback translation, and educational continuity. Traditional approaches often fail to adequately address these issues, creating stressful and inequitable learning environments. This article introduces the concept of precision education, a data-driven paradigm aimed at personalizing the educational experience for each learner. It explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI), including its subsets Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), can augment this model to tackle the inherent limitations of traditional assessment methods.AI can enable proactive data collection, offering consistent and objective assessments while reducing resource burdens. It has the potential to revolutionize not only competency assessment but also participatory interventions, such as personalized coaching and predictive analytics for at-risk trainees. The article also discusses key challenges and ethical considerations in integrating AI into medical education, such as algorithmic transparency, data privacy, and the potential for bias propagation.AI's capacity to process large datasets and identify patterns allows for a more nuanced, individualized approach to medical education. It offers promising avenues to not only improve the efficiency of educational assessments but also to make them more equitable.

Author Response: Challenges to Brain Death in Revising the Uniform Determination of Death Act: The UDDA Revision Series.,I thank Dr. Machado for his comments about my article summarizing the recent work of the US Uniform Law Commission to revise the Uniform Determination of Death Act.<sup>1</sup>.,2023,12,13
Editors' Note: Challenges to Brain Death in Revising the Uniform Determination of Death Act: The UDDA Revision Series.,"Despite decades of striving to simplify the diagnosis of <i>human</i> death according to irreversible cessation of function of a single organ system-the brain-we are relentlessly plagued by disagreement between experts spanning disciplines from medicine to philosophy. Dr. Bernat summarizes the current state of this controversy in their narrative summary, recently published in <i>Neurology</i>. In this review, the first of a planned series on the Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA) and brain death determination in <i>Neurology</i>, Dr. Bernat appraises the current criteria for determining brain death and highlights the need for careful revision to the UDDA. Is death determined by irreversible loss of function of the <i>brain-as-a-whole</i> or loss of function of the <i>whole</i> brain? And how does one define <i>irreversible</i> brain dysfunction? With the upcoming revisions to this statute by the US Uniform Law Commission (ULC), we hope to find more answers than new questions, although both are likely to be a consequence of this update. In response to the article, Dr. Machado proposes death be defined by irreversible failure of the 2 elements of consciousness-arousal and awareness. Furthermore, Dr. Machado challenges the notion of biological death and emphasizes the value of specific testing depending on the region of brain injury, with ancillary (neurophysiologic) testing in patients with posterior fossa lesions. Dr. Bernat comments that the objective of the ULC is not to disentangle the controversy of defining death, which may be <i>subjective</i>-e.g., influenced by personal beliefs, religious background, and interpretation of diagnostic testing-but instead to provide <i>objective</i> criteria for determining death. The revised UDDA may provide clarity in medical decision-making; however, it may not reconcile our division over ontology.",2023,12,13

Despite the result of some recent trials,<sup>3</sup> there is optimism and hope that treating individuals at preclinical stages could have even greater effects. A major challenge for the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of clinical trials on patients with preclinical AD, however, is the fact that cognitive and functional decline over time is mild.

How Do We Alleviate Long-Term Psychological Distress for Surrogate Decision Makers?,"Our perspective as clinicians is focused on the patient; however, when patients present with severe stroke, we rely on family or surrogate decision-makers to assist with decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment. In this issue of <i>Neurology®</i>, Morgenstern et al.<sup>1</sup> report on long-term psychological distress among surrogate decision-makers for patients with severe stroke. The authors used validated measures of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression among family surrogate decision-makers and found between 17% and 28% of surrogates to have high scores on measures of psychological distress. One or more high levels of the psychological outcomes were found in 17%-43% of surrogates, 2 or more were found in 12%-27%, and all 3 were found in 5%-16% of surrogates. The study population included a biethnic community of predominantly nonimmigrant Mexican American (MA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) persons, and outcomes were evaluated by ethnicity. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress remained worse among MA surrogates in the fully adjusted model; however, they were no longer significant for anxiety or depression after adjustment. The authors conclude that psychological distress is common among family surrogate decision-makers in the year after stroke and may be worse among MA surrogates. The authors propose that efforts are needed to support family members of all ethnic groups after severe stroke.",2023,12,20
Oral Health and Brain Health.,"Epidemiologic studies of the association between periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease, including stroke, had mixed findings.<sup>1</sup> Some studies have found that serum antibodies to major periodontal pathogens are associated with coronary heart disease (CHD), suggesting that periodontal infection or the host response to periodontal infection may play a causal role in CHD.<sup>1</sup> More recently, longitudinal studies have supported an association of periodontal disease between cognitive decline and dementia.<sup>2</sup> The motivation for these studies has been two-fold. First, periodontal disease is known to be associated with systemic inflammation,<sup>3</sup> which, in turn, is known to be causally associated with atherosclerotic disease.<sup>4</sup> Second, periodontal disease is potentially modifiable in the population. The limitation of all observational epidemiologic studies is the problem of confounding by incompletely measured or unmeasured variables, such as diet, health behaviors including oral hygiene, and the host response to infection. In addition, studies oral health and either cognitive decline or dementia may suffer from reverse causality; cognitive changes may lead to lessened oral hygiene and periodontal disease.",2023,12,20
Pearls & Oy-sters: Mesial Temporal Seizures in the Absence of the Mesial Temporal Lobe.,"Seizure semiology represents the clinical expression of the activation of the several brain regions comprising an epileptic network. In mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), this network includes the insular-opercular-neocortical temporal-hippocampal (IONTH) regions. In this study, we present the case of a patient with pharmacoresistant seizures characterized by nausea, lip-smacking, semipurposeful hand movements, and speechlessness, suggesting dominant hemisphere MTLE, with scalp video-EEG findings and left hippocampal sclerosis on brain MRI confirming the diagnosis. She underwent anterior temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy and was seizure-free for 14 years before relapsing. Recurrent seizure semiology was similar to preoperative seizures, that is, consistent with left MTLE, despite the medial temporal lobe missing. Seizures were therefore assumed to arise from remnant portions of the IONTH network-the insula, operculum, and posterolateral temporal neocortex. Reinvestigation including MEG localization of spikes and acute MRI changes following a seizure cluster suggested a left opercular region epilepsy. Our patient thus demonstrated the principle that seizures with mesial temporal characteristics may arise from outside the mesial temporal lobe (MTL). MTLE semiology arises from the activation of a set of structures (the seizure network) associated with the MTL, which can be triggered by foci both within and outside the MTL itself, and indeed even in its absence. However, it is not necessary to resect the entire extended network to bring about extended periods of seizure freedom in patients with refractory MTLE.",2023,12,19
Teaching NeuroImage: Cryptococcus in a Woman With Multiple Sclerosis on Fingolimod.,"A 33-year-old woman with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis who was on fingolimod for 5 years presented with a solitary skin lesion on her abdomen (Figure 1) for 2 months, which was unresponsive to antibiotics. The neurologic examination was normal. She denied having infectious symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath, recent travel, trauma to the area, or animal exposure. Her most recent absolute lymphocyte count was 0.22 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (reference 1.2-4.0 10<sup>9</sup>/L). The differential diagnosis included skinfold friction, dermatofibroma, pyoderma gangrenosum, and basal cell carcinoma. Although a dermatologist did not initially recommend a biopsy because the lesion was not ulcerated, she obtained one based on the recommendation of her neurologist. Shave biopsy revealed cryptococcal fungal infection (Figure 2). There was no evidence of asymptomatic disseminated cryptococcus. The proposed mechanism for the lesion involves a latent infection while immunocompetent with reactivation once immunocompromised.<sup>1</sup> Cryptococcus infections are associated with immunosuppression, most often due to human immunodeficiency virus infection, and only 6 fingolimod-associated cutaneous infections have been reported in the literature.<sup>2</sup> Patients with MS on immunosuppressant medication should be carefully screened for cutaneous infections.",2023,12,15
Association Between β-Amyloid Accumulation and Incident Dementia in Individuals 80 Years or Older Without Dementia.,"While the highest prevalence of dementia occurs in individuals older than 80 years, most imaging studies focused on younger populations.

Utility of peak inspiratory flow measurement for dry powder inhaler use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Every type of dry powder inhaler (DPI) device has its own intrinsic resistance. A patient's inspiratory effort produces a pressure drop that determines the inspiratory flow, depending on the inhaler's specific internal resistance. Optimal peak inspiratory flow (PIF) is needed for effective release of dry powder, disaggregation of drug-carrier agglomerates, and optimal deposition of respirable drug particles, particularly generation of a high fine-particle fraction to reach the small airways of the lungs. However, standardized recommendations for PIF measurements are lacking and instructions appeared vague in many instances.",2023,12,27
Cancer stem cells: a target for overcoming therapeutic resistance and relapse.,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small subset of cells in cancers that are thought to initiate tumorous transformation and promote metastasis, recurrence, and resistance to treatment. Growing evidence has revealed the existence of CSCs in various types of cancers and suggested that CSCs differentiate into diverse lineage cells that contribute to tumor progression. We may be able to overcome the limitations of cancer treatment with a comprehensive understanding of the biological features and mechanisms underlying therapeutic resistance in CSCs. This review provides an overview of the properties, biomarkers, and mechanisms of resistance shown by CSCs. Recent findings on metabolic features, especially fatty acid metabolism and ferroptosis in CSCs, are highlighted, along with promising targeting strategies. Targeting CSCs is a potential treatment plan to conquer cancer and prevent resistance and relapse in cancer treatment.",2023,12,29
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid assessment facilitates precision medicine for lung cancer.,"Lung cancer is the most common and fatal malignant disease worldwide and has the highest mortality rate among tumor-related causes of death. Early diagnosis and precision medicine can significantly improve the survival rate and prognosis of lung cancer patients. At present, the clinical diagnosis of lung cancer is challenging due to a lack of effective non-invasive detection methods and biomarkers, and treatment is primarily hindered by drug resistance and high tumor heterogeneity. Liquid biopsy is a method for detecting circulating biomarkers in the blood and other body fluids containing genetic information from primary tumor tissues. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is a potential liquid biopsy medium that is rich in a variety of bioactive substances and cell components. BALF contains information on the key characteristics of tumors, including the tumor subtype, gene mutation type, and tumor environment, thus BALF may be used as a diagnostic supplement to lung biopsy. In this review, the current research on BALF in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of lung cancer is summarized. The advantages and disadvantages of different components of BALF, including cells, cell-free DNA, extracellular vesicles, and microRNA are introduced. In particular, the great potential of extracellular vesicles in precision diagnosis and detection of drug-resistant for lung cancer is highlighted. In addition, the performance of liquid biopsies with different body fluid sources in lung cancer detection are compared to facilitate more selective studies involving BALF, thereby promoting the application of BALF for precision medicine in lung cancer patients in the future.",2023,12,29

Characterization of the distribution and dynamics of chromatin states in the <i>C. elegans</i> germ line reveals substantial H3K4me3 remodeling during oogenesis.,"Chromatin organization in the <i>C. elegans</i> germ line is tightly regulated and critical for germ cell differentiation. While certain germline epigenetic regulatory mechanisms have been identified, how they influence chromatin structure and ultimately gene expression remains unclear, in part because most genomic studies have focused on data collected from intact worms comprising both somatic and germline tissues. We therefore analyzed histone modification and chromatin accessibility data from isolated germ nuclei representing undifferentiated proliferating and meiosis I populations to define chromatin states. We correlated these states with overall transcript abundance, spatio-temporal expression patterns, and the function of small RNA pathways. Because the essential role of the germ line is to transmit genetic information and establish gene expression in the early embryo, we compared epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles from undifferentiated germ cells to those of embryos to define the epigenetic changes during this developmental transition. The active histone modification H3K4me3 exhibits particularly dynamic remodeling as germ cells differentiate into oocytes, which suggests a mechanism for establishing early transcription of essential genes during zygotic genome activation. This analysis highlights the dynamism of the chromatin landscape across developmental transitions and provides a resource for future investigation into epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in germ cells.",2023,12,26
Nanobody-mediated dualsteric engagement of the angiotensin receptor broadens biased ligand pharmacology.,"Dualsteric G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands are a class of bitopic ligands that consist of an orthosteric pharmacophore, which binds to the pocket occupied by the receptor's endogenous agonist, and an allosteric pharmacophore, which binds to a distinct site. These ligands have the potential to display characteristics of both orthosteric and allosteric ligands. To explore the signaling profiles that dualsteric ligands of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) can access, we ligated a 6e epitope tag-specific nanobody (single-domain antibody fragment) to angiotensin II (AngII) and analogs that show preferential allosteric coupling to Gq (TRV055, TRV056) or β‑arrestin (TRV027). While the nanobody itself acts as a probe-specific neutral or negative allosteric ligand of <i>N</i>‑terminally 6e-tagged AT1R, nanobody conjugation to orthosteric ligands had varying effects on Gq dissociation and β‑arrestin plasma membrane recruitment. The potency of certain AngII analogs was enhanced up to 100-fold, and some conjugates behaved as partial agonists, with up to a 5-fold decrease in E<sub>max</sub> Nanobody conjugation also biased the signaling of TRV055 and TRV056 towards Gq, suggesting that Gq bias at AT1R can be modulated through molecular mechanisms distinct from those previously elucidated. Both competition radioligand binding experiments and functional assays demonstrated that orthosteric antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers) act as non-competitive inhibitors of all these nanobody-peptide conjugates. This proof-of-principle study illustrates the array of pharmacological patterns that can be achieved by incorporating neutral or negative allosteric pharmacophores into dualsteric ligands. Nanobodies directed towards linear epitopes could provide a rich source of allosteric reagents for this purpose. <b>Significance Statement</b> Here we engineer bitopic (dualsteric) ligands for epitope-tagged angiotensin II type 1 receptor by conjugating angiotensin II or its biased analogs to an epitope-specific nanobody (antibody fragment). Our data demonstrate that nanobody-mediated interactions with the receptor <i>N</i>‑terminus endow angiotensin analogs with properties of allosteric modulators and provide a novel mechanism to increase the potency, modulate the maximal effect, or alter the bias of ligands.",2023,12,21
<b>Inhibition of cardiac Kv4.3/KChIP2 channels by a sulfonylurea drug gliquidone</b>.,"The Kv4.3 channel is featured of fast N-type inactivation and also undergoes a slow C-type inactivation. The gain-of-function mutations of Kv4.3 channels cause an inherited disease called Brugada syndrome characterized by a shortened duration of cardiac action potential repolarization and ventricular arrhythmia. The sulfonylurea drug gliquidone, an ATP-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channel antagonist, is widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Here, we report a novel role of gliquidone in inhibiting Kv4.3 and Kv4.3/KChIP2 channels that encode the cardiac Ito currents responsible for the initial phase of action potential repolarization. Gliquidone results in concentration-dependent inhibition of both Kv4.3 and Kv4.3/KChIP2 fast or steady-state inactivation currents with an IC<sub>50</sub> of approximately 8 μM. Gliquidone also accelerates Kv4.3 channel inactivation and shifts the steady-state activation to a more depolarizing direction. Site-directed mutagenesis and molecular docking reveal that the residues S301 in the S4 and Y312A, L321A in the S4-S5 linker are critical for gliquidone-mediated inhibition of Kv4.3 currents, as mutating those residues to alanine significantly reduces the potency for gliquidone-mediated inhibition. Furthermore, gliquidone also inhibits a gain-of-function Kv4.3 V392I mutant identified in BrS patients in voltage- and concentration-dependent manner. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that gliquidone inhibits Kv4.3 channels by acting on the residues in the S4 and the S4-S5 linker. Therefore, gliquidone may hold repurposing potential for the therapy of Brugada syndrome. <b>Significance Statement</b> We describe a novel role of gliquidone in inhibiting cardiac Kv4.3 currents and the channel gain-of-function mutation identified from patients with Brugada syndrome, suggesting its repurposing potential for therapy for the heart disease.",2023,12,21
Bilateral retinofugal pathfinding impairments limit behavioral compensation in near-congenital one-eyed <i>Xenopus laevis</i>.,"To generate a coherent visual percept, information from both eyes must be appropriately transmitted into the brain, where binocular integration forms the substrate for visuomotor behaviors. To establish the anatomical substrate for binocular integration, the presence of bilateral eyes and interaction of both optic nerves during retinotectal development play a key role. However, the extent to which embryonic monocularly derived visual circuits can convey visuomotor behaviors is unknown. In this study, we assessed the retinotectal anatomy and visuomotor performance of embryonically generated one-eyed tadpoles. In one-eyed animals, the axons of retinal ganglion cells from the singular remaining eye exhibited striking irregularities in their central projections in the brain, generating a non-canonical ipsilateral retinotectal projection. This data is indicative of impaired pathfinding abilities. We further show that these novel projections are correlated with an impairment of behavioral compensation for the loss of one eye.<b>Significance Statement</b> This study suggests that embryonic sensory imbalance has more far-reaching effects on function compared to acute loss in already established circuits. More generally, bilaterality of sensory organs is the norm across all vertebrates as well as many invertebrates, and our results contribute to a general understanding of how developmental programs, as well as behaviours reliant on them, pivotally depend on the presence of sensory inputs from both body sides.",2023,12,20
Negative-Pressure Ventilation in the Pediatric ICU.,"Negative-pressure ventilation (NPV) is a form of noninvasive ventilation that has been recently utilized in pediatric acute respiratory failure. Negative-pressure ventilators apply negative pressure onto the chest wall via a cuirass to recruit areas of atelectasis. Continuous negative extrathoracic pressure, the most common mode, is similar to CPAP, where negative pressure is maintained at a constant level throughout the respiratory cycle while patients initiate their own breaths and continue to breathe spontaneously throughout. Control mode, which is similar to bi-level positive airway pressure, alternates negative pressure with positive pressure and controls both phases of breathing at a mandatory frequency set higher than the patient's spontaneous frequency. Supplemental oxygen is provided through a nasal cannula or face mask due of the lack of NPV devices' interface with the mouth or nose. NPV can improve preload to the heart and cardiac output (CO) in patients with restrictive right-ventricular physiology requiring CO augmentation and those with Fontan physiology. The purpose of this article is to review the physiological principles of spontaneous and NPV, examine the evidence supporting the use of NPV, give practical and meaningful guidance on its clinical application in the pediatric ICU, and summarize areas for future studies on its uses.",2023,12,19

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: interdisciplinary creative art practice and nature connections.,"Scoliosis is an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine with the large majority of cases classed as idiopathic, meaning there is no known cause. Typically, most cases occur in children and young people affecting approximately three per cent of the adult populace with five out of six cases being female. The <i>BackBone: Interdisciplinary Creative Practices and Body Positive Resilience</i> pilot research study used arts and humanities methods to measure the impact of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) on well-being and body perception. The research aimed to contribute to a better understanding of alternative treatments towards improving quality of life in young women diagnosed with AIS. In particular, concentrating on two highlighted priorities from the Scoliosis Priority Setting Partnership: (1) How is quality of life affected by scoliosis and its treatment? How can we measure this in ways that are meaningful to patients? (2) How are the psychological impacts (including on body image) of diagnosis and treatment best managed.Using established medical techniques, art-based workshops, and focus groups with postoperative participants with AIS and their families we gathered both quantitative and qualitative data. The workshops explored the aesthetics of imperfection through material investigations that focus on the body as both an object and how it is experienced using the metaphor of tree images. Drawing parallels between the growth patterns of trees that, for complex and often unknown reasons, have grown unexpectedly we explored questions around ideological notions of perfect growth through art-making in a non-clinical setting. Uniquely, the pilot project sought to draw on insights from four key disciplines (art, medicine, psychology and human geography), thinking across boundaries to evoke different ways of knowing and understanding the complexities of body perception through image-making.",2023,12,21
Mammals achieve common neural coverage of visual scenes using distinct sampling behaviors.,"Most vertebrates use head and eye movements to quickly change gaze orientation and sample different portions of the environment with periods of stable fixation. Visual information must be integrated across fixations to construct a complete perspective of the visual environment. In concert with this sampling strategy, neurons adapt to unchanging input to conserve energy and ensure that only novel information from each fixation is processed. We demonstrate how adaptation recovery times and saccade properties interact, and thus shape spatiotemporal tradeoffs observed in the motor and visual systems of mice, cats, marmosets, macaques, and humans. These tradeoffs predict that in order to achieve similar visual coverage over time, animals with smaller receptive field sizes require faster saccade rates. Indeed, we find comparable sampling of the visual environment by neuronal populations across mammals when integrating measurements of saccadic behavior with receptive field sizes and V1 neuronal density. We propose that these mammals share a common statistically driven strategy of maintaining coverage of their visual environment over time calibrated to their respective visual system characteristics.<b>Significance Statement</b> Mammals rapidly move their eyes to sample their visual environment over successive fixations, but they use different spatial and temporal strategies for this sampling. We demonstrate that these different strategies achieve similar neuronal receptive field coverage over time. Because mammals have distinct sensory receptive field sizes and neuronal densities for sampling and processing information, they require different eye movement strategies to encode natural scenes.",2023,12,19
Conceptual anatomy of the female genitalia using text mining and implications for patient care.,"This article analyses the conceptual histories of words associated with female genital parts to explore how they may affect the lived experience of people with these parts and the quality of gynaecological care they receive. Specifically, we examine the implications of using the word 'vagina' to replace the word 'vulva', or indeed to indicate the entire female genitalia. This article does so through an analysis of existing scholarly work and through text mining methods such as word frequencies, most distinctive word collocates and word-embeddings drawn from literary and women's magazine corpora. We find that words indicating specific female genital parts are very infrequently mentioned in our corpora, which shows that there is a troubling lack of exposure and education in our socio-cultural context when it comes to the female genital anatomy. When they are mentioned, their usage reflects historical and patriarchal associations that have been primarily attached to the word 'vagina'. When it comes to the 'vagina' and 'vulva', the penis is the most prevalent association by far; whereas the most commonly occurring female genital parts are parts to do with reproduction-reinforcing a long-standing and disproportionate emphasis on the female genitalia's reproductive function. Our research also reveals a concerning emphasis on non-evidence-based female hygiene products, thus perpetuating the damaging stereotype of the dirty vagina. These findings may explain many negative patient outcomes such as stigma attached to seeking out timely gynaecological care, lack of informed medical consent and non-evidence-based practices exacerbated by problematic cultural depictions of the female genitalia. They can also explain the neglect of female sexual agency, pleasure and well-being. Understanding historical and contemporary usages of words for the female genitalia has important implications for the quality of patient care today and is a critical component of gender and reproductive justice.",2023,12,26
Value of <sup>68</sup>Ga-FAPI-04 and <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT in Early Prediction of Pathologic Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer.,"This prospective study investigated whether PET parameters from <sup>18</sup>F-FDG and <sup>68</sup>Ga-fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI)-04 PET/CT can predict a pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) early in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC). <b>Methods:</b> The study included 28 patients with LAGC who underwent <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT and <sup>68</sup>Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT at baseline and after 1 cycle of NAC. PET parameters including SUV and tumor-to-background ratio (TBR), as well as the change rate of SUV and TBR, were recorded. Patients were classified as major or minor pathologic responders according to postoperative pathology findings. We compared the PET parameters between the 2 pathologic response groups and different treatment regimens and analyzed their predictive performance for tumor pathologic response. <b>Results:</b> Major pathologic responders had significantly lower <sup>68</sup>Ga-FAPI change rates (percentage SUV<sub>max</sub> [%SUV<sub>max</sub>], percentage SUV<sub>peak</sub> [%SUV<sub>peak</sub>], and percentage TBR [%TBR]) than minor pathologic responders. Among the PET parameters, <sup>68</sup>Ga-FAPI %SUV<sub>max</sub> (area under the curve, 0.856; <i>P</i> = 0.009), %SUV<sub>peak</sub> (area under the curve, 0.811; <i>P</i> = 0.022), and %TBR (area under the curve, 0.864; <i>P</i> = 0.007) were significant parameters for early prediction of pathologic response to NAC in LAGC; they had the same predictive accuracy of 89.29%, with the thresholds of decrease to at least 52.43%, 60.46%, and 52.96%, respectively. In addition, <sup>68</sup>Ga-FAPI %SUV<sub>max</sub> and %TBR showed significant differences between the different treatment regimens. <b>Conclusion:</b> In this preliminary study, <sup>68</sup>Ga-FAPI-04 PET change rate parameters were preferable to <sup>18</sup>F-FDG in predicting pathologic response to NAC at an early stage in LAGC. <sup>68</sup>Ga-FAPI %SUV<sub>max</sub> and %TBR may be better predictors of therapeutic response between different treatment regimens. These findings may help optimize the treatment for patients with LAGC.",2023,12,21
Intranasal Delivery of Ketamine Induces Cortical Disinhibition.,"Our previous studies find that subcutaneously administered (s.c.) subanesthetic ketamine promotes sustained cortical disinhibition and plasticity in adult mouse binocular visual cortex (bV1). We hypothesized that intranasal delivery (i.n.) of subanesthetic ketamine may have similar actions. To test this, we delivered ketamine (10 mg/kg; i.n.) to adult mice, and then recorded excitatory pyramidal neurons or PV+ interneurons in L2/3 of bV1 slices. In pyramidal neurons the baseline IPSC amplitudes from mice treated with ketamine are significantly weaker than in control mice. Acute bath application of neuregulin-1 (NRG1) to cortical slices increases these IPSC amplitudes in mice treated with ketamine but not in controls. In PV+ interneurons the baseline EPSC amplitudes from mice treated with ketamine are significantly weaker than in control mice. Acute bath application of NRG1 to cortical slices increases these EPSC amplitudes in mice treated with ketamine but not in controls. We also find that mice treated with ketamine exhibit increased pCREB staining in L2/3 of bV1. Together, our results show that a single intranasal delivery of ketamine reduces PV+ interneuron excitation, and reduces pyramidal neuron inhibition, and that these effects are acutely reversed by NRG1. These results are significant as they show that intranasal delivery of ketamine induces cortical disinhibition, which has implications for the treatment of psychiatric, neurologic, and ophthalmic disorders.<b>Significance Statement</b> We show that intranasal delivery of a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine in the mouse model has profound effects on the microcircuitry in sensory cortex. We find that intranasal delivery of ketamine reduces parvalbumin-expressing interneuron (PV) excitation and reduces pyramidal neuron inhibition. Disinhibition is a critical step for promoting cortical neuroplasticity by ketamine therapy. Despite the very important clinical use of intranasal ketamine, surprisingly few publications have reported using this route of administration in animal models for translational research. Here, we show how intranasal ketamine modulates the circuitry to bring about cortical disinhibition.",2023,12,14
Open-source instrumented object to study dexterous object manipulation.,"Humans use tactile feedback to perform skillful manipulation. When tactile sensory feedback is unavailable, for instance, if the fingers are anesthetized, dexterity is severely impaired. Imaging the deformation of the finger pad skin when in contact with a transparent plate provides information about the tactile feedback received by the central nervous system. Indeed, skin deformations are transduced into neural signals by the mechanoreceptors of the finger pad skin. Understanding how this feedback is used for active object manipulation would improve our understanding of human dexterity. In this paper, we present a new device for imaging the skin of the finger pad of one finger during manipulation performed with a precision grip. The device's mass (300 g) makes it easy to use during unconstrained dexterous manipulation. Using this device, we reproduced the experiment performed in Delhaye et al. 2021a. We extracted the strains aligned with the object's movement, i.e., the vertical strains in the ulnar and radial parts of the fingerpad, to see how correlated they were with the grip force (GF) adaptation. Interestingly, parts of our results differed from those in Delhaye et al. 2021a due to weight and inertia differences between the devices, with average GF across participants differing significantly. Our results highlight a large variability in the behavior of the skin across participants, with generally low correlations between strain and GF adjustments, suggesting that skin deformations are not the primary driver of GF adaptation in this manipulation scenario.<b>Significance statement</b> In this paper, we introduce a new device weighing 300 g and capable of imaging the skin of the finger pad of one finger during manipulation performed with a precision grip. This object is also capable of recording the forces and accelerations applied to the object. We reproduced the experiment performed in Delhaye et al. 2021a using this device. We extracted the strains aligned with the object's movement to analyze how correlated these strains were with GF adaptation. The behavior of the skin across participants presented a large variability, and we observed low correlations between strain and GF adjustments in most participants. Our results suggest that skin deformations are not the primary driver of GF adaptation in this manipulation scenario.",2023,12,14

"Pre-operative psoas muscle index, a surrogate for sarcopenia; as a predictor of post-esophagectomy complications.","Esophagectomy is the standard of care for curative esophageal cancer. However, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Esophageal cancer is known to negatively affect the nutritional status of patients and many manifest cancer sarcopenia. At present, measures of sarcopenia involve complex and often subjective measurements. We assess whether the Psoas Muscle Index (PMI); an inexpensive, simple, validated method used to diagnose sarcopenia, can be used to predict adverse outcomes in patients after curative esophagectomy.",2023,12,30
"Stillbirth risk factors, causes and evaluation.","Stillbirth impacts 5.73 per 1,000 births in the United States and this rate exceeds that of contemporary high-resource countries.<sup>1</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>2</sup> Risk factors include both demographic and medical characteristics. There are also numerous pathophysiologic mechanisms that can lead to stillbirth. Unfortunately, these risk factors are fairly common, making stillbirth risk stratification and prevention challenging. This is due in part to a large number of unexplained stillbirths. In a large, multi-center study of stillbirths, approximately 24% of stillbirths remained unexplained following thorough, standardized evaluation.<sup>3</sup> The number of unexplained stillbirths is unquestionably larger outside of a rigorous study protocol, but real-world data are lacking. This large proportion of unexplained stillbirth cases makes achieving further decreases in the stillbirth rate difficult given lack of understanding of underlying causes in this population. Cause of death identification can be improved with adoption of an evidence-based, comprehensive stillbirth evaluation.",2023,12,19
"Profile of lactic acid bacteria (MALDI-TOF-MS) and physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics of the raw milk and fresh artisanal cheese from Serra Geral, Minas Gerais, Brazil.","Artisanal cheese from Serra Geral, Minas Gerais, Brazil, stands out for its cultural asset and socio-economic relevance. However, standards of identity and quality and the peculiar terroir associated with the edaphoclimatic conditions have not been established. Therefore, the production flow diagram and the physico-chemical and microbiological quality of the raw milk, pingo (natural starter culture), production benches, water and fresh cheese were investigated for the first time. In addition, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from cheese and its production environment were identified by MALDI-TOF. For that, 12 cheese making facilities were selected. The raw milk and pingo showed adequate physico-chemical characteristics for cheesemaking; however, high microbial counts were found. In the water, total and thermotolerant coliforms were also identified. The fresh cheeses were classified as 'high moisture and fat' and 'soft mass'. Most physico-chemical parameters were satisfactory; however, there were high counts of total coliforms, Staphylococcus spp. and coagulase-positive staphylococci. There were high counts of LAB in the raw milk, pingo, bench surface and fresh cheese. A total of 84 microbial biotypes from MRS agar were isolated. Lactococcus lactis was the predominant LAB, followed by Lactococcus garvieae. Leuconostoc mesenteroides (benches), Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (fresh cheese), and Enterococcus faecium (pingo) were identified sporadically. These results indicate the risks to public health associated with the consumption of the fresh cheese, and measures to improve its safety are needed.",2023,12,07
Potential bioactive peptides obtained after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of wine lees from sequential fermentations.,"The biotechnological reuse of winery by-products has great potential to increase the value and sustainability of the wine industry. Recent studies revealed that yeast biomass can be an exciting source of bioactive peptides with possible benefits for human health, and its incorporation in plant-based foods is considered innovative and sustainable. In this study, we aimed to identify, through in silico analyses, potential bioactive peptides from yeast extracts after in vitro digestion. Wine lees from a non-Saccharomyces oenological yeast, Starmerella bacillaris FRI751, Saccharomyces cerevisiae EC1118, and sequential fermentation performed with both strains (SEQ) were recovered in a synthetic must. Cellular pellets were enzymatically treated with zymolyase, and the yeast extracts were submitted to in vitro gastrointestinal digestions. LC-MS/MS sequenced the hydrolyzed peptides, and their potential bioactivity was inferred. S. bacillaris FRI751 fermentation showed 132 peptide sequences, S. cerevisiae EC1118 60, SEQ 89. A total of 243 unique peptide sequences were identified across the groups. Furthermore, based on the peptide sequence, the FRI751 extract showed the highest potential antihypertensive with 275 bioactive fragments. Other bioactivities, such as antimicrobial and immunomodulatory, were also identified in all yeast extracts. A potential antiobesity bioactive peptide VVP was identified only in the yeast extract from S. bacillaris single strain. The wine lees from S. bacillaris single strain and SEQ fermentation are a richer source of potential bioactive peptides than those from S. cerevisiae fermentation. This study opens new possibilities in the valorization of winemaking by-products.",2023,12,07
Improving the texture attributes of squid meat (sthenoteuthis oualaniensis) with slight oxidative and phosphate curing treatments.,"This study aimed to improve the pasty texture of squid meat by oxidative and phosphate curing (OPC) treatment, and elucidate the underlying mechanism. The shear force, springiness, weight gain, water-holding capacity (WHC), color and sensory evaluation of squid meat samples treated with a mild OPC approach (OPC_2, 10 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution with complex phosphate solution) were significantly improved. However, the samples subjected to over-oxidized (20 and 30 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution with complex phosphate solution) treatment did not obtain favorable outcomes. Microstructure analysis revealed that muscle fibers aggregated after moderate OPC treatments, leading to an increased spacing between muscle fiber bundles. This gap facilitated a more uniform distribution and restriction of water, according to low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) results. The results from in vitro simulated oxidation of myofibrillar proteins (MPs) demonstrated that increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> led to formation of carbonyl groups and decreased sulfhydryl groups, and even secondary structure changes, according to fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Particle size, zeta potential and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl amide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results showed that oxidation caused protein aggregation into larger molecules. This study presents a novel approach to improve pasty texture of squid meat.",2023,12,07
Investigating biomechanical alterations and emptying patterns after various gastrojejunostomy strategy.,"Gastrojejunostomy is a prominent approach in managing distal gastric cancer that is unresectable due to gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). Research has demonstrated that stomach-partitioning gastrojejunostomy (SPGJ) exhibits superior clinical efficacy compared to conventional gastrojejunostomy (CGJ), however, the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon remains elusive. This study constructed 3D models of the SPGJ and CGJ based on the computed tomography (CT) images obtained from a patient diagnosed with distal gastric cancer. The biomechanical patterns of these procedures in the digestive system were subsequently compared through numerical simulations and in vitro experiments. The results of the numerical simulation demonstrated that the model following SPGJ promoted the discharge of food through the anastomotic orifice and into the lower jejunum. Furthermore, a decrease in passage size after partitioning, the low-level velocity of esophageal, and an increase in contents viscosity effectively inhibited the flow through the passage to the pylorus, ultimately reducing stimulation to tumor. The study also revealed that favorable gastric emptying is associated with a smaller passage and faster inlet velocity, and that lower contents viscosity. ​The experimental findings conducted in vitro demonstrated that SPGJ exhibited superior efficacy in obstructing the flow near the pylorus in comparison to CGJ. Moreover, a decrease in passage size correlates with a reduction in fluid flow towards the pylorus. These results provide the foundation of theory and practice for the surgical management of patients with GOO resulting from unresectable distal gastric cancer, and have potential implications for clinical interventions.",2023,12,03
"Exploring the heterogeneity of community and function and correspondence of ""species-enzymes"" among three types of Daqu with different fermentation peak-temperature via high-throughput sequencing and metagenomics.","The enzyme activity of Daqu is an important prerequisite for defining it as a Baijiu starter. However, little is known about the functional species related to enzymes in different types of Daqu at the metagenomic level. Therefore, we analyzed the differences in enzymatic properties, microbial composition and metabolic function of three types of Daqu, namely high-, medium- and low-temperature Daqus (HTD, MTD and LTD), by combining chemical feature and multi-dimensional sequencing. The results showed that both liquefaction, saccharification, fermentation and esterification powers were remarkably weaker in HTD compared to MTD and LTD. Totally, 30 bacterial and 5 fungal phyla were identified and significant differences in community structures were also observed among samples, with Brevibacterium/Microascus, Pseudomonas, and Lactobacillus/Saccharomycopsis identified as biomarkers for HTD, MTD and LTD, respectively. Additionally, the importance of deterministic assembly in bacterial communities was proportional to the fermentation peak-temperature, while stochastic assembly dominated in fungal ones. Metagenomics analysis indicated eukaryota (>80 %, mainly Ascomycota) predominated in HTD and MTD while bacteria (54.3 %, mainly Actinobacteriota) were more abundant in LTD. However, the functional profiles and pathways of MTD and LTD were more similar, and the synthesis and metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids were the crucial biological functions of all samples. Finally, the relationship between species and enzymes in different samples was constructed and the functional species in LTD and MTD were more diverse than HTD, which elucidated the functional species associated with enzyme activity in each type of Daqu. These results will greatly enrich our understanding of the core functional species in three typical Daqu, which provide available information for rational regulation of Daqu quality and the Baijiu fermentation.",2023,12,04
Microfluidic advances in food safety control.,"Food contamination is a global concern, particularly in developing countries. Two main types of food contaminants-chemical and biological-are common problems that threaten human health. Therefore, rapid and accurate detection methods are required to address the threat of food contamination. Conventional methods employed to detect these two types of food contaminants have several limitations, including high costs and long analysis time. Alternatively, microfluidic technology, which allows for simple, rapid, and on-site testing, can enable us to control food safety in a timely, cost-effective, simple, and accurate manner. This review summarizes advances in microfluidic approaches to detect contaminants in food. Different detection methods have been applied to microfluidic platforms to identify two main types of contaminants: chemical and biological. For chemical contaminant control, the application of microfluidic approaches for detecting heavy metals, pesticides, antibiotic residues, and other contaminants in food samples is reviewed. Different methods including enzymatic, chemical-based, immunoassay-based, molecular-based, and electrochemical methods for chemical contaminant detection are discussed based on their working principle, the integration in microfluidic platforms, advantages, and limitations. Microfluidic approaches for foodborne pathogen detection, from sample preparation to final detection, are reviewed to identify foodborne pathogens. Common methods for foodborne pathogens screening, namely immunoassay, nucleic acid amplification methods, and other methods are listed and discussed; highlighted examples of recent studies are also reviewed. Challenges and future trends that could be employed in microfluidic design and fabrication process to address the existing limitations for food safety control are also covered. Microfluidic technology is a promising tool for food safety control with high efficiency and applicability. Miniaturization, portability, low cost, and samples and reagents saving make microfluidic devices an ideal choice for on-site detection, especially in low-resource areas. Despite many advantages of microfluidic technology, the wide manufacturing of microfluidic devices still demands intensive studies to be conducted for user-friendly and accurate food safety control. Introduction of recent advances of microfluidic devices will build a comprehensive understanding of the technology and offer comparative analysis for future studies and on-site application.",2023,12,03
"An opportunity for acerola pulp (Malpighia emarginata DC) valorization evaluating its performance during the block cryoconcentration by physicochemical, bioactive compounds, HPLC-ESI-MS/MS, and multi-elemental profile analysis.","The present study evaluated the effect of cryoconcentration of pulp blocks of acerola (Malpighia emarginata DC). The study evaluated cryoconcentration in three stages. The cryoconcentrated samples, the ice fractions, and the initial pulp were evaluated for physicochemical composition, bioactive composition, and multielement profile. The cryoconcentrated sample obtained in the third stage of cryoconcentration showed the best results for the concentration factor, process efficiency, total soluble solids content, red color intensity, and increasing of the macro and micronutrients: Cu, Ca, S, Sr, K, Mn, Na, P, Mg, Fe. All stages presented good performance in the total soluble solids content, increase in the titratable acidity of the concentrates, and progressive increase in the intensity of the red color. Generally, higher levels of total phenolic and antioxidant activity were found for the 2nd and 3rd concentrates. The phenolic activity showed an increase of 166.90% in the 3rd stage concentrate compared to fresh pulp, and the antioxidant activity was 112.10% by the ABTS method and 131.60% by the DPPH method, both in the 3rd stage concentrate. The major individual polyphenols were Ferulic acid, Protocatechuic acid, and Taxifolin, with significant increases in the concentration of the compounds in the 2nd and 3rd stage concentrates. In addition, the contents of potentially toxic metals were below detection limits. During the cryoconcentration process, there was a decrease in the values ​​of vitamin C content, moisture content, density, and elements Cu, Sr, and Zn.",2023,12,04
What are the main obstacles to turning foods healthier through probiotics incorporation? a review of functionalization of foods by probiotics and bioactive metabolites.,"Functional foods are gaining significant attention from people all over the world. When added to foods, probiotic bacteria can turn them healthier and confer beneficial health effects, such as improving the immune system and preventing cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. However, adding probiotics to foods is a challenging task. The processing steps often involve high temperatures, and intrinsic food factors, such as pH, water activity, dissolved oxygen, post-acidification, packaging, and cold storage temperatures, can stress the probiotic strain and impact its viability. Moreover, it is crucial to consider these factors during food product development to ensure the effectiveness of the probiotic strain. Among others, techniques such as microencapsulation and lyophilization, have been highlighted as industrial food functionalization strategies. In this review, we present and discuss alternatives that may be used to functionalize foods by incorporating probiotics and/or delivering bioactive compounds produced by probiotics. We also emphasize the main challenges in different food products and the technological characteristics influencing them. The knowledge available here may contribute to overcoming the practical obstacles to food functionalization with probiotics.",2023,12,02
High-temperature glycosylation of saccharides to modify molecular conformation of egg white protein and its effect on the stability of high internal phase emulsions.,"This paper investigates the freeze-thaw stability of oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by high-temperature wet heating glycosylation products. Glucose (Glu), D-fructose (Fru), xylose (Xyl), maltodextrin (MD), oligofructose (FO), and oligomeric isomaltulose (IMO) were chosen as sugar sources for the glycosylation reaction with egg white proteins (EWPs) at 120 °C to prepare the GEWPs. The study reveals that the type of sugar significantly influences the Maillard reactions with EWPs. The degree of glycosylation was highest in the Xyl group with the greatest reducing capacity and lowest in the MD, FO, and IMO groups. High-temperature wet glycosylation treatment induced changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of EWP. Elevated temperature exposed hydrophobic groups within the protein, while covalent binding of hydrophilic carbohydrates via the Maillard reaction decreased the protein's H<sub>0</sub> value. Improved foaming and emulsifying properties were attributed to the increase in α-helix content, disulfide bond formation, and reduced surface tension. Emulsions prepared from GEWPs exhibited higher apparent viscosity and G' compared to those from natural EWPs, with the GEWP/Xyl group showing the highest values. After freeze-thaw treatment, the GEWP/Fru and GEWP/FO groups demonstrated superior stability and reduced freezing point, along with minimal microstructural alterations. These findings underscore the importance of sugar type in the stability of high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) stabilized by GEWPs, indicating that a tailored Maillard reaction can yield stabilizers with exceptional freeze-thaw stability for emulsions.",2023,12,04
Process and quality parameters of convective dried yacon: Influence of ethanol treatment.,"Yacon is a highly perishable tuberous root, rich in fructooligosaccharides (FOS). Convective drying preceded by ethanol treatment (ET) is an alternative for increasing shelf life in a shorter process. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of ET and temperature (50 °C and 70 °C) on quality parameters (fructan retention, total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, shrinkage, color and microstructural parameters) and process parameters (drying time, drying kinetics, and energy consumption) in the convective drying of yacon slices. The ET induced structural alterations in the tissues and cells that aids in the reduction of drying time up to 28.00 %. ET resulted in an increase in effective diffusivity and leaded to noteworthy reduction in energy consumption (up to 22.72 %). The quality parameters such as color, shrinkage, and total phenolic content showed no significant differences among the treatments. The use of ethanol promoted highest preservation of antioxidant activity; however, it caused degradation of FOS. The ethanol pretreated drying at 50 °C was the better condition for lower consumption and preservation of quality parameters as total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity and fructan retention, but the samples dried at 50 °C were the ones with the highest fructan retention (55.11 ± 2.19 %).",2023,12,16

Risk implications induced by behaviors of artificial and pavement-generated TWPs in river water: Role of particle-self properties and incubation aging.,"Here, we investigated the pristine properties of three typical tire wear particles (TWPs) and their aging properties after incubation in runoff (primary aging) and sewage (further aging), and captured the differences in the behavioral characteristics of nine TWPs in river water, with a view to paving the way for revealing the intrinsic mechanism of the hydroecological effects of TWPs. Our results highlight that the generation modes of three pristine tire wear particles (TWPs), stemming from typical tire and road wear processes-specifically, rolling friction (R-TWPs) and sliding friction (S-TWPs), alongside cryogenically milled tire treads (C-TWPs)-significantly impact their pristine physicochemical properties. This impact encompasses surface structure, particle size (D [4,3]: 8.5-121.3 μm), surface potential (-10.4 ∼ -1.8 mV), contact angle (95.2-129.8°), density (1.09-1.75 kg/m<sup>3</sup>), etc., consequently, these differences significantly influence their migration capability and sorption capacity during the incubation and aging in runoff and sewage. Interestingly, after incubation and aging in the migrating aqueous phase, particularly with additional aging in sewage, not only do distinctions in the aforementioned physicochemical properties (namely, particle size (5.6-6.6 μm), surface potential (-18.4 ∼ -18.1 mV), contact angle (124.5-125.4°), density (1.05-1.16 kg/m<sup>3</sup>)) among various types of TWPs diminish, but the environmental behaviors (encompassing, desorption capacity, aggregation kinetics, photochemical activity-formation of persistent free radicals, and exudation-derivative (6PPD-Quinone) of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine: 6PPD) exhibited by this array of TWPs demonstrate a remarkable coherence within the downstream river water. Concerningly, the aforementioned features of aquatic system behaviors appear to be predisposed towards exacerbating the heightened toxicity of TWPs, for example, the leaching concentration of 6PPD-Q increased by two to three times after aging, aligning with established precedents regarding the toxicological causes associated with the quinone derivatives of antioxidants in rubber contaminants.",2023,12,30
The effect of PK gene overexpression on content and antioxidant properties of carotenoids in marine microalga Dunaliella parva.,"Dunaliella parva can extensively accumulate carotenoids, which is a promising raw material for carotenoids production. Carotenoids have important medicinal value. D. parva is an ideal organism for studying the mechanism of carotenoid synthesis. Our previous study identified a transcription factor DpAP2 which could regulate carotenoid synthesis in D. parva. In addition, DpAP2 could interact with three proteins with different activities (DNA binding transcription factor activity, protein kinase activity, and alpha-D-phosphohexomutase). To investigate the function of PK gene encoding interacting protein of DpAP2 with protein kinase activity in D. parva, PK gene was cloned into vector pBI221-GFP-UbiΩ-CAT and transformed into D. parva in this study. The results showed that overexpression of PK gene enhanced the contents of carotenoids, total sugars, proteins, and antioxidant activities of carotenoid extract such as superoxide radical scavenging activity, reducing power, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity in transgenic D. parva with overexpression of PK gene. This study explored the function of PK gene, and improved the medicinal value of D. parva.",2023,12,30
The application prospect and challenge of the alternative methanol fuel in the internal combustion engine.,"In the context of global carbon neutrality, the internal combustion engines aim to further reduce the carbon emission and improve the fuel economy for the transportation sector. Methanol is treated as a renewable, reliability, and applicability energy, which also shows some superior physicochemical properties compared to the traditional fossil fuels. However, some challenges such as cold start issue, low fuel economy, high unregulated emissions need to address before the methanol widely applies in the engines. This article comprehensively reviews the physicochemical properties and production processes of the methanol, the cold start issue of the methanol engine, and emission and combustion characteristics of the methanol engine for evaluating its potential effect of emission reduction and energy saving in the transportation sector. In addition, different optimization strategies and advanced technologies are proposed and comprehensively discussed in this paper for addressing the issues of the cold start, combustion and emissions of the methanol engines in the real application. Finally, the conclusions and prospects of the methanol engine are presented for promoting its application in the transportation sector and further reducing the carbon emission in the near future, thereby achieving the carbon peak and carbon neutrality in the China.",2023,12,30
"An integrated coastal ecosystem monitoring strategy: Pilot case in Naf-Saint Martin Peninsula, Bangladesh.","Rapid population growth creating an excessive pressure on the marine environment and thus monitoring of marine ecosystem is essential. However, due to high technical and financial involvement, monitoring of coastal ecosystem is always challenging in developing countries. This study aims to develop an integrated coastal ecosystem monitoring system that combines scientific sampling, numerical model simulation and citizen science observations to monitor the coastal ecosystem of Bangladesh. This concept of integrated monitoring approach was piloted from January 2022 to April 2023 at the South East coastal zone of Bangladesh. Scientific sampling and numerical model simulations were performed for temperature and salinity data collection. Citizen science approach was employed to collect data on environmental conditions, fisheries, plankton, other marine resources, and plastic pollution.

Comparison of the calcium signaling alterations in GABA-ergic medium spiny neurons produced from iPSCs of different origins.,"Disease models based on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are in high demand because of their physiological adequacy and well-reproducibility of the pathological phenotype. Nowadays, the most common approach to generate iPSCs is the reprogramming of somatic cells using vectors based on lentivirus or Sendai virus. We have previously shown impairments of calcium signaling including store-operated calcium entry in Huntington's disease-specific iPSCs-based GABA-ergic medium spiny neurons. However, different approaches for iPSCs generation make it difficult to compare the models since the mechanism of reprogramming may influence the electrophysiological properties of the terminally differentiated neurons. Here, we have studied the features of calcium homeostasis in GABA-ergic medium spiny neurons differentiated from iPSCs obtained from fibroblasts of the same donor using different methods. Our data demonstrated that there were no significant differences neither in calcium influx through the store-operated channels, nor in the levels of proteins activating this type of calcium entry in neurons differentiated from iPSCs generated with lenti- and Sendai viruses-based approaches. We also found no differences in voltage-gated calcium entry for these neurons. Thus, we clearly showed that various methods of cell reprogramming result in similar deregulations in neuronal calcium signaling which substantiates the ability to combine the experimental data on functional studies of ion channels in models based on iPSCs obtained by different methods and expands the prospects for the use of biobanking.",2023,12,30

New resource food-arabinogalactan improves DSS-induced acute colitis through intestinal flora and NLRP3 signaling pathway.,"Colitis can significantly impact daily life. This study utilized DSS to induce acute colitis in mice and examined the regulatory effect of arabinogalactan (AG). The findings demonstrated that AG intake effectively alleviated the phenotype of DSS-induced colitis in mice and protected against small intestine damage. Furthermore, AG suppressed the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-1β, while promoting the secretion of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10. It also inhibited the secretion of LPS in serum and MPO in colon tissue. Additionally, AG regulated the NF-κB/MAPK/PPARγ signaling pathway and inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway, thereby ameliorating DSS-induced colitis inflammation in mice. AG also influenced the metabolism of short-chain fatty acids, particularly butyrate, in the intestinal tract of mice. Moreover, AG modulated and enhanced the composition of intestinal flora in mice with colitis, increasing the diversity of dominant flora and promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria. These results highlight the protective effects of arabinogalactan against colitis and its potential applications in the food industry.",2023,12,30
Synthesis and characterization of chitosan-copper nanocomposites and their catalytic properties for 4-nitrophenol reduction.,"Biopolymer-based copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) have become an area of significant interest due to their wide-ranging applications in a variety of fields. However, there remains a challenge in tailoring their morphologies and improving their properties. In this study, CuNPs were synthesized via wet chemical reduction using sodium hypophosphite monohydrate (NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O), l-ascorbic acid and chitosan. The effect of different synthesis conditions, including reaction pH, temperature, time, concentration of NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O, l-ascorbic acid and chitosan, as well as the deacetylation degree (DD) of chitosan, on the synthesis of CuNPs was investigated. The synthesized CuNPs were characterized by various analytical techniques. The catalytic properties of synthesized CuNPs were investigated for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in the presence of sodium borohydride. The synthesis-morphology-catalytic activity relationship of CuNPs was discussed. The results suggested that the morphology of CuNPs could be adjusted by controlling the synthesis conditions. Chitosan DD significantly impacts the morphology of the synthesized CuNPs. As the chitosan DD decreased from 91.8 % to 52.3 %, the average particle size of synthesized CuNPs decreased from 43.9 ± 10.6 to 17.7 ± 5.9 nm and the shape changed from anisotropy to near-sphere. CuNPs synthesized using low DD (53.2 %) chitosan (CuNPs-N3) demonstrated the highest 4-NP conversion rate of 99.1 % and reaction rate constant of 0.3540 min<sup>-1</sup>. CuNPs-N3 was thermodynamically and kinetically more feasible than CuNPs synthesized with high DD chitosan. These findings provide important insights for further designing and developing hierarchical nanostructured CuNPs catalysts for broader applications.",2023,12,30
"Multi-omics analysis of small RNA, transcriptome, and degradome to identify putative miRNAs linked to MeJA regulated and oridonin biosynthesis in Isodon rubescens.","Isodon rubescens has garnered much attention due to its anti-tumor or anti-cancer properties. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of oridonin biosynthesis leveraging the regulatory network between small RNAs and mRNAs. In this study, the regulatory networks of miRNAs and targets were examined by combining mRNA, miRNA, and degradome. A total of 348 miRNAs, including 287 known miRNAs and 61 novel miRNAs, were identified. Among them, 51 miRNAs were significantly expressed, and 36 miRNAs responded to MeJA. A total of 3066 target genes were associated with 228 miRNAs via degradome sequencing. Multi-omics analysis demonstrated that 27 miRNA-mRNA pairs were speculated to be involved in MeJA regulation, and 36 miRNA-mRNA pairs were hypothesized to be involved in the genotype-dependence of I. rubescens. Furthermore, 151 and 7 miRNA-mRNA modules were likely engaged in oridonin biosynthesis as identified by psRNATarget and degradome sequencing, respectively. Some miRNA-mRNA modules were confirmed via RT-qPCR. Moreover, miRNAs targeting plant hormone signal transduction pathway genes were identified, such as miR156, miR167, miR393, and PC-3p-19822_242. Collectively, our results demonstrate for the first time that miRNAs are identified in I. rubescens, and laid a solid foundation for further research on the molecular mechanism of oridonin biosynthesis mediated by miRNA.",2023,12,30
"PvMR1, a novel C-type lectin plays a crucial role in the antibacterial immune response of Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei.","C-type lectins (CTLs) are important immune molecules in innate immune, which participate in non-self recognition and clearance of pathogens. Here, a new CTL with two distinct C-type lectin domains (CTLDs) from Pacific white shrimp Penaeus vannamei, designated as PvMR1 was identified. The obtained PvMR1 coding sequence (CDS) was 1044 bp long encoding a protein with 347 amino acids. PvMR1 had two CTLD, a conserved mannose-specific EPN motif and a galactose-specific QPD motif, clustering into the same branch as the crustacean CTLs. PvMR1 was widely distributed in shrimp tissues with the highest transcription level in the hepatopancreas, with significantly induced mRNA expression on the hepatopancreas and intestines after immune challenge with Vibrio anguillarum. In vitro assays with recombinant PvMR1 (rPvMR1) protein revealed that it exhibited a wide range of antimicrobial activity, bacterial binding ability, and bacterial agglutination activity in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner. Moreover, PvMR1 promoted bacterial phagocytosis in hemocytes. Furthermore, rPvMR1 treatment could significantly enhance the bacterial clearance in hemolymph and greatly improved the survival of shrimp under V. anguillarum infection in vivo. These results collectively suggest that PvMR1 plays an important role in antibacterial immune response of P. vannamei.",2023,12,30
Enhancing microalgal biomass production in lab-scale raceway ponds through innovative computational fluid dynamics-based electrode deflectors.,"The design of novel electrode deflector structures (EDSs) introduced a promising strategy for enhancing raceway ponds performance, increasing carbon fixation, and improving microalgal biomass accumulation. The computational fluid dynamics, based flow field principles, proved that the potency of arc-shaped electrode deflector structures (A-EDS) and spiral electrode deflector structures (S-EDS) were optimal. These configurations yielded superior culture effects, notably reducing dead zones by 9.1% and 11.7%, while elevating biomass increments of 14.7% and 11.5% compared to the control, respectively. In comparison to scenarios without electrostatic field application, the A-EDS group demonstrated pronounced post-stimulation growth, exhibiting an additional biomass increase of 11.2%, coupled with a remarkable 23.6% surge in CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rate and mixing time reduction by 14.7%. A-EDS and S-EDS, combined with strategic electric field integration, provided a theoretical basis for promoting microalgal biomass production and enhancing carbon fixation in a raceway pond environment to similar production practices.",2023,12,30
Pulmonary interstitial lymphography: A prospective trial with potential impact on stereotactic ablative radiotherapy planning for early-stage lung cancer.,This prospective feasibility trial investigated pulmonary interstitial lymphography to identify thoracic primary nodal drainage (PND). A post-hoc analysis of nodal recurrences was compared with PND for patients with early-stage lung cancer; larger studies are needed to establish correlation. Exploratory PND-inclusive stereotactic ablative radiotherapy plans were assessed for dosimetric feasibility.,2023,12,30

The effects of VY closure on lip morphology after Le Fort I maxillary advancement: A systematic review.,"VY closure of the Le Fort 1 incision may commonly be indicated to mitigate the lip shortening effects of maxillary advancement. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate if VY closure prevents lip shortening when compared with conventional continuous closure (CS) methods, in patients who underwent le fort 1 maxillary advancement. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were accessed. Hand searching was also performed. Observational studies, non-randomised and randomized controlled trials were included if Le Fort 1 maxillary advancement was performed to correct a dentofacial deformity. Comparisons were made between VY and CS, and morphological changes to the upper lip were evaluated. The demographic data, study methodology, magnitude of maxillary movements and outcomes related to the lip morphology (length, vermillion exposure, thickness and angulation) were extracted. The search yielded 487 articles. Six studies were included after the application of the selection criteria. A total of 100 and 94 patients received CS and VY respectively. VY was not found to reliably prevent lip shortening. VY was more likely to mitigate lip shortening when there is a large maxillary advancement. It was consistent for a protrusive or ""rolled-out"" lip morphology to occur after a VY closure. This was demonstrated by the increase in lip vermillion exposure, thickness, and angulation. VY closure was a useful adjunctive technique in patients undergoing large maxillary advancements to mitigate the lip shortening effect from the procedure. Surgeons who employ this technique must also be aware of the consequence of a more protrusive lip with increased vermillion exposure and assess if this would be aesthetically desirable for the individual patient.",2023,12,30
Germline genetic associations for hepatobiliary cancers.,"Hepatobiliary cancers (HBC) include hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder carcinoma, which originate from the liver, bile ducts, and gallbladder. They are responsible for a substantial burden of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite knowledge of risk factors and advancements in therapeutics and surgical interventions, the prognosis for most patients with HBC remains bleak. There is evidence from familial aggregation and case-control studies to suggest a familial risk component in HBC susceptibility. Recent progress in genomics research has led to the identification of germline variants including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in cancer-associated genes associated with HBC risk. These findings emerged from genome-wide association studies and next-generation sequencing techniques such as whole-exome sequencing. Patients with other cancer types, including breast, colon, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer, are recommended by guidelines to undergo germline genetic testing, but similar recommendations are lagging in HBC. This prompts the question of whether multi-gene panel testing should be integrated into clinical guidelines for HBC management. Here, we review the hereditary genetics of HBC, explore studies investigating SNPs and P/LP variants in HBC patients, discuss the clinical implications and potential for personalized treatments and impact on patient's family members, and conclude that additional studies are needed to examine how genetic testing can be applied clinically.",2023,12,30
Remediation of organic pollutant from the aqueous environment using in-house fabricated polyaniline-based hybrid composite (PANI-MnPBA/NiCoMnS) materials.,"Polyaniline-based hybrid material (PANI-MnPBA/NiCoMnS) was prepared by hydrothermal-solvothermal approach. Synthesized hybrid material was characterized through FTIR-spectroscopy, p-XRD, SEM, EDX, BET, and Zetasizer techniques. Hybrid material as adsorbent for removal of Congo red (CR) from water system showed excellent results such as 98 % removal efficiency and 254 mg/g adsorption capacity. Furthermore, various studies like adsorption isothermal, kinetic, thermodynamic, and statistical analysis were performed to understand the adsorption phenomenon. From various kinetic models, pseudo-first and second-order kinetic models, intra-particle and liquid film diffusion kinetic models, pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and liquid-film diffusion kinetic model both are most suitable for explaining the adsorption phenomenon due to the greater value of R<sup>2</sup> (0.955) for CR. According to these kinetic models, physio-sorption and diffusion play a basic role in the adsorption of CR. Moreover, ΔG (-1779.508 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) and ΔH (61,760.889 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) values explained the spontaneous and exothermic nature of the adsorption process, respectively. Furthermore, for support of the adsorption mechanism via electrostatic attractions before and after the adsorption process FTIR results of as-synthesized adsorbent were measured (NH peaks before 3668.88, after 3541.41 cm<sup>-1</sup>). These results confirm electrostatic attraction for the adsorption process. Finally, the statistical model was added (n < 1), according to this model, adsorption follows a multi-anchorage approach and adsorbent contains enough sites for adsorption of CR.",2023,12,30
Microcystin-LR-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like cells acquire resistance to multi-toxins.,"The protein phosphatase inhibitor microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a hepatocyte-selective cyanotoxin, induces phenotypic changes in HEK293 OATP1B3-expressing (HEK293-OATP1B3) cells, which include cytoskeletal reorganization (HEK293-OATP1B3-AD) and anoikis resistance (HEK293-OATP1B3-FL) transformed cells, respectively. These cells acquire resistance to MC-LR and partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics. In cancer cells, EMT is generally involved in multi-drug resistance. Here, we focused on the multi-drug resistance of HEK293-OATP1B3-AD and HEK293-OATP1B3-FL cells. The MTT assay and immunoblotting were conducted to examine the responses of HEK293-OATP1B3, HEK293-OATP1B3-AD, and HEK293-OATP1B3-FL cells to multiple toxins and drugs that function as substrates for OATP1B3, including MC-LR, nodularin (Nod), okadaic acid (OA), and cisplatin (CDDP). HEK293-OATP1B3-AD and HEK293-OATP1B3-FL cells were more resistant to MC-LR, Nod, and OA than HEK293-OATP1B3 cells. Conversely, the three cell types were equivalently sensitive to CDDP. By using protein phosphatase assay, the reduction of the inhibitory effect of MC-LR and Nod on phosphatase activity might be one reason for the resistance to MC-LR and Nod in HEK293-OATP1B3-AD and HEK293-OATP1B3-FL cells. Furthermore, the parental HEK293-OATP1B3 cells showed enhanced p53 phosphorylation and stabilization after MC-LR exposure, while p53 phosphorylation was attenuated in HEK293-OATP1B3-AD and HEK293-OATP1B3-FL cells. Moreover, in HEK293-OATP1B3-AD and HEK293-OATP1B3-FL cells, AKT phosphorylation was higher than that of the parental HEK293-OATP1B3 cell line. These results suggest that the multi-toxin resistance observed in HEK293-OATP1B3-AD and HEK293-OATP1B3-FL cells is associated with AKT activation and p53 inactivation.",2023,12,30

Cryo-forum: A framework for orientation recovery with uncertainty measure with the application in cryo-EM image analysis.,"In single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), efficient determination of orientation parameters for particle images poses a significant challenge yet is crucial for reconstructing 3D structures. This task is complicated by the high noise levels in the datasets, which often include outliers, necessitating several time-consuming 2D clean-up processes. Recently, solutions based on deep learning have emerged, offering a more streamlined approach to the traditionally laborious task of orientation estimation. These solutions employ amortized inference, eliminating the need to estimate parameters individually for each image. However, these methods frequently overlook the presence of outliers and may not adequately concentrate on the components used within the network. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses a 10-dimensional feature vector to represent the orientation and applies a Quadratically-Constrained Quadratic Program to derive the predicted orientation as a unit quaternion, supplemented by an uncertainty metric. Furthermore, we propose a unique loss function that considers the pairwise distances between orientations, thereby enhancing the accuracy of our method. Finally, we also comprehensively evaluate the design choices in constructing the encoder network, a topic that has not received sufficient attention in the literature. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that our methodology effectively recovers orientations from 2D cryo-EM images in an end-to-end manner. Notably, the inclusion of uncertainty quantification allows for direct clean-up of the dataset at the 3D level. Lastly, we package our proposed methods into a user-friendly software suite named cryo-forum, designed for easy access by developers.",2023,12,30

Regulating electronic structure of Fe single-atom site by S/N dual-coordination for efficient Fenton-like catalysis.,"The activity of single-atom catalysts in peroxymonosulfate activation process is bound up with the local electronic state of metal center. However, the large electronegativity of N atoms in Metal-N<sub>4</sub> restricts the electron transfer between center metal atom and peroxymonosulfate. Herein, we constructed Fe-SN-C catalyst by incorporating S atom in the first coordination sphere of Fe single-atom site (Fe-S<sub>1</sub>N<sub>3</sub>) for Fenton-like catalysis. The Fe-SN-C with a low valent Fe is found to exhibit excellent catalytic activity for bisphenol A degradation, and the corresponding rate constant reaches 0.405 min<sup>-1</sup>, 11.9-fold higher than the original Fe-N-C. Besides, the Fe-SN-C/PMS system exhibits ideal catalytic stability under the effect of wide pH range and background substrates by the fast generation of high-valent Fe species. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the dual coordination of S and N atoms notably increases the local electron density of Fe atoms and electron filling in e<sub>g</sub> orbital, causing a d band center shifting close to the fermi level and thereby optimizes the activation energy for peroxymonosulfate decomposition via Fe 3d-O 2p orbital interaction. This work provides further development of promising SACs for the efficient activation of peroxymonosulfate based on direct regulation of the coordination environment of active center metal atoms.",2023,12,28
Comparative transcriptome analysis and Arabidopsis thaliana overexpression reveal key genes associated with cadmium transport and distribution in root of two Capsicum annuum cultivars.,"The molecular mechanisms underlying high and low cadmium (Cd) accumulation in hot pepper cultivars remain unclear. In this study, comparative transcriptome analysis of root between high-Cd (J) and low-Cd (Z) cultivars was conducted under hydroponic cultivation with 0 and 0.4 mg/L Cd, respectively. The results showed that J enhanced the root uptake of Cd by elevating the expression of Nramp5 and counteracting Cd toxicity by increasing the expression of genes, such as NIR1, GLN1, and IAA9. Z reduced Cd accumulation by enhancing the cell wall lignin synthesis genes PAL, COMT, 4CL, LAC, and POD and the Cd transporters ABC, MTP1, and DTX1. Elevated expression of genes related to sulfur metabolism was observed in Z, potentially contributing to its ability to detoxify Cd. To investigate the function of CaCOMT1, an Arabidopsis thaliana overexpression line (OE-CaCOMT1) was constructed. The results revealed that OE-CaCOMT1 drastically increased the lignin content by 38-42% and reduced the translocation of Cd to the aboveground parts by 32%. This study provides comprehensive insights into the mechanisms underlying Cd accumulation in hot pepper cultivars using transcriptome analysis. Moreover, this study elucidates the critical function of CaCOMT1, providing a theoretical foundation for the production of low-Cd vegetables for food safety.",2023,12,28
"Testate amoebae (Arcellinida, Amoebozoa) community diversity in New England bogs and fens assessed through lineage-specific amplicon sequencing.","Testate amoebae (order Arcellinida) are abundant in freshwater ecosystems, including low pH bogs and fens. Within these environments, Arcellinida are considered top predators in microbial food webs and their tests are useful bioindicators of paleoclimatic changes and anthropogenic pollutants. Accurate species identifications and characterizations of diversity are important for studies of paleoclimate, microbial ecology, and environmental change; however, morphological species definitions mask cryptic diversity, which is a common phenomenon among microbial eukaryotes. Lineage-specific primers recently designed to target Arcellinida for amplicon sequencing successfully captured a poorly-described yet diverse fraction of the microbial eukaryotic community. Here, we leveraged the application of these newly-designed primers to survey the diversity of Arcellinida in four low-pH New England bogs and fens, investigating variation among bogs (2018) and then across seasons and habitats within two bogs (2019). Three OTUs represented 66% of Arcellinida reads obtained across all habitats surveyed. 103 additional OTUs were present in lower abundance with some OTUs detected in only one sampling location, suggesting habitat specificity. By establishing a baseline for Arcellinida diversity, we provide a foundation to monitor key taxa in habitats that are predicted to change with increasing anthropogenic pressure and rapid climate change.",2023,12,15
Dual optical detection approach for capillary electrophoresis following two-step liquid-liquid extraction to determine ten phenols in water samples.,"In this research, the analytical method was developed and evaluated for determining phenol and its nine derivatives belong to the US EPA priority pollutant list in water samples by using dual-channeled capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled with two types of optical detectors, namely LED-induced fluorescence (LEDIF) and ultraviolet (UV) detectors. The optimal background electrolytes for the first and second CE channels were 20 mM borate (pH 9.80) with 400 µM fluorescein and 55 mM borate (pH 11.75), respectively. The two-step liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) was used for sample preparation and enrichment, in which phenol and its derivatives were extracted from the aqueous phase using 10 mL of n-hexane/1-octanol (60/40, v/v) and then were back extracted into a 0.1 M NaOH as a final acceptor phase. Under the optimal CE and two-step LLE conditions, the enrichment factors of 10 phenols were 184 - 1120-fold, and the method detection limits were lowered to 0.02-0.60 µg/L. The obtained intra-day and inter-day precisions in terms of relative standard deviations (RSD) were between 4.0 and 7.3 % and 6.7 and 14 %, respectively. This approach was used to determine phenols in water samples, with recoveries ranging from 82.0 to 108.9 %. In combination with sample enrichment by two-step LLE extraction, this is the first CE study conducted to determine phenols in the EPA list using two detector approaches, specifically CE-LEDIF/CE-UV.",2023,12,26
An integrated method for IgG N-glycans enrichment and analysis: Understanding the role of IgG glycosylation in diabetic foot ulcer.,"Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is the most common and serious complication of diabetes, and its incidence, disability, and mortality rates are increasing worldwide. The pathogenesis of DFU is associated with dysregulated inflammation mediated by abnormal immunoglobulin G (IgG) glycosylation. In this study, we developed a comprehensive method for IgG N-linked glycosylation in the serum of DFU patients. Through analysis, we identified 31 IgG1 glycans, 32 IgG2 glycans, and 30 IgG4 glycans in the DFU serum. Furthermore, 13 IgG1 glycans, 12 IgG2 glycans, and 5 IgG4 glycans in the DFU groups were found to be significantly different from those of the control groups (p < 0.05). Of these, compared with the control group, one glycan was unique to DFU patients, and seven glycans were not detected in the DFU group. In terms of glycan characteristics, we observed a substantial decrease in galactosylation, sialylation and bisecting GlcNAcylation, and a significant increase in agalactosylation. Abnormal IgG N-glycosylation modifications were significantly associated with the chronic inflammation that is characteristic of DFU. Further, this is the first comprehensive analysis of subclass-specific IgG N-glycosylation in DFU patients, which not only fills the gap of DFU in terms of the pathological mechanisms related to IgG glycosylation but also may provide valuable clues for the immunotherapeutic pathway of DFU.",2023,12,27
Social Threat-Safety Test Uncovers Psychosocial Stress-Related Phenotypes.,"Social stress is a major cause of the development of mental disorders. To enhance the translational value of preclinical studies, social stress experience and its behavioral impact on mice should be comparable to humans. Chronic social defeat (CSD) utilizes a type of social stress involving physical attacks and sensory threats to induce mental dysfunctions resembling human affective disorders. To strengthen the psychosocial component of CSD, a 10-day CSD protocol was applied in which daily physical attacks are standardized to three 10 s episodes followed by a 24 h sensory phase. After the 10<sup>th</sup> sensory phase, the CSD protocol is followed by a refined behavioral assay called the social threat-safety test (STST). Post-stress behavioral assays need to determine how and to what extent the social stressor has influenced behavior. The STST allows chronically socially defeated male mice to interact with 2 novel male individuals (social targets): one social target from the attacking strain encountered during the CSD days and the other from a novel strain. Both are presented simultaneously in different compartments of a three-chambered test arena. The test enables a simultaneous assessment of social avoidance development to measure successful aversive conditioned learning and social threat-safety discrimination ability. The development of social avoidance towards both strains reflects a generalized aversive response and thus, a measurement of stress susceptibility. Meanwhile, the development of social avoidance towards only the attacking strain reflects threat-safety discrimination and thus, a measurement of stress resilience. Finally, the absence of social avoidance towards the attacking strain reflects impaired aversive conditioned learning. The protocol aims to refine the currently used mouse models of stress susceptibility/resilience by including translational criteria, specifically threat-safety discrimination and aversive response generalization, to categorize a single group of chronically socially defeated animals into resilient and susceptible subgroups, eventually advancing future translational approaches.",2023,12,15
Growth and development impact of sustainable nutrition education: An experimental study.,"Healthy societies are formed by learning and maintaining sustainable healthy eating behaviors from childhood. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of short-term sustainable nutrition education on growth and development parameters of preschool children. This study is an experimental design with pretest-posttest control group. This study was carried out in two kindergartens between February 2022 and June 2023 in Turkey. The education group received 4 months of dietary behavior training. The dietary scale and anthropometric measurements were administered at the first and last meetings. Data were analyzed with 95% confidence interval. The study was completed with 174 children. A statistically significant difference was found, especially in body weight (p < 0.05) and body weight percentile values (p < 0.05) in the posttest of the education group. A statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) was found between the groups in the eating behavior scale posttest score. Nutrition education in schools is important in promoting healthy eating habits. Nutrition education improves eating behavior positively. To maintain healthy eating behaviors, however, the continuity of education is necessary. In addition, as growth and development are physical processes, it is recognized that growth and development cannot be assessed by nutrition alone.",2023,12,31
"Preparation, characterization, and release properties of Rosa roxburghii Tratt seed oil and β-carotene-coloaded proliposomes.","Rosa roxburghii Tratt seed oil (RSO) and β-carotene (βC) were chosen to prepare proliposomes by the thin-film dispersion method. The characteristics of unloaded proliposome, RSO proliposome (L-R), βC proliposome (L-β), and RSO/βC proliposome (L-R-β) were analyzed, and their antioxidant activity, storage stability, and release properties were investigated. The proliposomes had an encapsulation efficiency (RSO, βC) higher than 83.10%, nanometer size, smooth surface, and irregular structure. L-R-β showed better dispersibility, stability, and antioxidant activity than L-R and L-β. Simultaneous encapsulation of RSO and βC reduced the phospholipid oxidation of proliposomes and improved the retention rate of RSO in storage environments of 4, 25, and 40°C. Moreover, the RSO and βC release kinetics of proliposomes in the simulated saliva fluid and gastric fluid phases can be described by the first-order model, and the Korsmeyr-Peppas method was applied to describe their release mechanism in the simulated intestinal fluid phase.",2023,12,31
"Design of Ion Channel Confined Binary Metal Cu-Fe Selenides for All-Climate, High-Capacity Sodium Ion Batteries.","Exploring special anode materials with high capacity, stable structure, and extreme temperature feasibility remains a great challenge in secondary sodium based energy systems. Here, a bimetallic Cu-Fe selenide nanosheet with refined nanostructure providing confined internal ion transport channels are reported, in which the structure improves the pseudocapacitance and reduces the charge transfer resistance for making a significant contribution to accelerating the reaction dynamics. The CuFeSe<sub>2</sub> nanosheets have a high initial specific capacity of 480.4 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.25 A g<sup>-1</sup> , showing impressively excellent rate performance and ultralong cycling life over 1000 cycles with 261.1 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 2.5 A g<sup>-1</sup> .

Subtractive Patterning of Nanoscale Thin Films Using Acid-Based Electrohydrodynamic-Jet Printing.,"As an alternative to traditional photolithography, printing processes are widely explored for the patterning of customizable devices. However, to date, the majority of high-resolution printing processes for functional nanomaterials are additive in nature. To complement additive printing, there is a need for subtractive processes, where the printed ink results in material removal, rather than addition. In this study, a new subtractive patterning approach that uses electrohydrodynamic-jet (e-jet) printing of acid-based inks to etch nanoscale zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD) is introduced. By tuning the printing parameters, the depth and linewidth of the subtracted features can be tuned, with a minimum linewidth of 11 µm and a tunable channel depth with ≈5 nm resolution. Furthermore, by tuning the ink composition, the volatility and viscosity of the ink can be adjusted, resulting in variable spreading and dissolution dynamics at the solution/film interface. In the future, acid-based subtractive patterning using e-jet printing can be used for rapid prototyping or customizable manufacturing of functional devices on a range of substrates with nanoscale precision.",2023,12,31
Fatigue-Resistant Polymer Electrolyte Membranes for Fuel Cells.,"In a hydrogen fuel cell, an electrolyte membrane conducts protons, but blocks electrons, hydrogen molecules, and oxygen molecules. The fuel cell often runs unsteadily, resulting in fluctuating water production, causing the membrane to swell and contract. The cyclic deformation can cause fatigue crack growth. This paper describes an approach to develop a fatigue-resistant polymer electrolyte membrane. The membrane is prepared by forming an interpenetrating network of a plastic electrolyte and a rubber. The former conducts protons, and the latter enhances fatigue resistance. The introduction of the rubber modestly reduces electrochemical performance, but significantly increases fatigue threshold and lifespan. Compared to pristine plastic electrolyte, Nafion, an interpenetrating network of Nafion and perfluoropolyether (PFPE) reduces the maximum power density by 20%, but increases the fatigue threshold by 175%. Under the wet/dry accelerated stress test, the fuel cell with the Nafion-PFPE membrane has a lifespan 1.7 times that of a fuel cell with the Nafion membrane.",2023,12,31
Surface Engineering of Natural Killer Cells with CD44-targeting Ligands for Augmented Cancer Immunotherapy.,"Adoptive immunotherapy utilizing natural killer (NK) cells has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in treating hematologic malignancies. However, its clinical intervention for solid tumors is hindered by the limited expression of tumor-specific antigens. Herein, lipid-PEG conjugated hyaluronic acid (HA) materials (HA-PEG-Lipid) for the simple ex-vivo surface coating of NK cells is developed for 1) lipid-mediated cellular membrane anchoring via hydrophobic interaction and thereby 2) sufficient presentation of the CD44 ligand (i.e., HA) onto NK cells for cancer targeting, without the need for genetic manipulation. Membrane-engineered NK cells can selectively recognize CD44-overexpressing cancer cells through HA-CD44 affinity and subsequently induce in situ activation of NK cells for cancer elimination. Therefore, the surface-engineered NK cells using HA-PEG-Lipid (HANK cells) establish an immune synapse with CD44-overexpressing MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells, triggering the ""recognition-activation"" mechanism, and ultimately eliminating cancer cells. Moreover, in mouse xenograft tumor models, administrated HANK cells demonstrate significant infiltration into solid tumors, resulting in tumor apoptosis/necrosis and effective suppression of tumor progression and metastasis, as compared to NK cells and gemcitabine. Taken together, the HA-PEG-Lipid biomaterials expedite the treatment of solid tumors by facilitating a sequential recognition-activation mechanism of surface-engineered HANK cells, suggesting a promising approach for NK cell-mediated immunotherapy.",2023,12,31
Microfluidic-Aerosol Hyphenated Synthesis of Metal-Organic Framework-Derived Hybrid Catalysts for CO<sub>2</sub> Utilization.,"A new and efficient technique is developed by combining the hyphenated microfluidic- and aerosol-based synthesis with the coupled differential mobility analysis for the effective and continuous synthesis and simultaneous analysis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived hybrid nanostructured products. HKUST-1, a copper-based MOF, is chosen as the representative to fabricate Cu-based hybrid catalysts for reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, an effective route for CO<sub>2</sub> utilization. The effect of precursor concentration and carrier selection on the properties of the resulting products, including mobility size distribution, crystallization degree, surface area, and metal dispersion are investigated, as well as the correlation between the material properties of the synthesized catalysts and their catalytic performance in RWGS reaction in terms of conversion ratio/rate, selectivity, and operational stability. The results indicate that the continuous microfluidic droplet system can successfully synthesize MOF colloids, followed by the continuous production of MOF-derived hybrid materials through the tandem aerosol spray-drying-reaction system. High catalytic activity and low initiate temperature toward RWGS (turnover frequency = 0.0074 s<sup>-1</sup> ; 450 °C) are achievable. The work facilitates the production and the designed concept of relevant MOF-derived hybrid nanostructured catalysts in the continuous synthesis system and the enhancement of applications in CO<sub>2</sub> capture and utilization.",2023,12,31
Self-Assembled and Polymerized Hierarchical Nanostructure Films of Cyanostilbene-Based Reactive AIEgens for Smart Chemosensors.,"For the development of acid-responsive advanced fluorescent films with a 2D nanostructure, a pyridyl cyanostilbene-based AIEgen (PCRM) is newly synthesized. The synthesized PCRM exhibits aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and responds reversibly to acid and base stimuli. To fabricate the nanoporous polymer-stabilized film, PCRM and 4-(octyloxy)benzoic acid (8OB) are complexed in a 1:1 ratio through hydrogen bonding. The PCRM-8OB complex with a smectic mesophase is uniaxially oriented at first and photopolymerized with a crosslinker. By subsequently removing 8OB in an alkaline solution, nanopores are generated in the self-assembled and polymerized hierarchical 2D nanostructure film. The prepared nanoporous fluorescent films exhibit not only the reversible response to acid and base stimuli but also mechanical and chemical robustness. Since the nanoporous fluorescent films have different sensitivities to trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) depending on the molecular orientation in the film, advanced acid vapor sensors that can display the risk level according to the concentration of TFA are demonstrated. Reactive AIEgens-based hierarchical nanostructure films with nanopores fabricated by a subsequent process of self-assembly, polymerization, and etching can open a new door for the development of advanced chemosensors.",2023,12,31
S3 guideline Atopic dermatitis: Part 2 - Systemic treatment.,"The present S3 guideline was created based on the European English-language S3 guideline, with special consideration given to the medical conditions in the German-speaking region, and with additions from the previous German-language version, in accordance with the criteria of the AWMF.

Additionally, it discusses systemic off-label therapies. The first part of the guideline, published separately, includes the definition and diagnostic aspects of AD, describes topical therapy, non-drug therapy approaches, and addresses aspects related to special patient groups.",2023,12,31
Unveiling facial kinship: The BioKinVis dataset for facial kinship verification and genetic association studies.,"Facial image-based kinship verification represents a burgeoning frontier within the realms of computer vision and biomedicine. Recent genome-wide association studies have underscored the heritability of human facial morphology, revealing its predictability based on genetic information. These revelations form a robust foundation for advancing facial image-based kinship verification. Despite strides in computer vision, there remains a discernible gap between the biomedical and computer vision domains. Notably, the absence of family photo datasets established through biological paternity testing methods poses a significant challenge. This study addresses this gap by introducing the biological kinship visualization dataset, encompassing 5773 individuals from 2412 families with biologically confirmed kinship. Our analysis delves into the distribution and influencing factors of facial similarity among parent-child pairs, probing the potential association between forensic short tandem repeat polymorphisms and facial similarity. Additionally, we have developed a machine learning model for facial image-based kinship verification, achieving an accuracy of 0.80 in the dataset. To facilitate further exploration, we have established an online tool and database, accessible at http://120.55.161.230:88/.",2023,12,31
Inducible transgene expression in CHO cells using an artificial transcriptional activator with estrogen-binding domain.,"Biopharmaceuticals, including therapeutic antibodies, are rapidly growing products in the pharmaceutical market. Mammalian cells, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, are widely used as production hosts because recombinant antibodies require complex three-dimensional structures modified with sugar chains. Recombinant protein production using mammalian cells is generally performed with cell growth. In this study, we developed a technology that controls cell growth and recombinant protein production to induce recombinant protein production with predetermined timing. Expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and a single-chain antibody fused with the Fc-region of the human IgG1 (scFv-Fc) gene can be induced and mediated by the estrogen receptor-based artificial transcription factor Gal4-ERT2-VP16 and corresponding inducer drugs. We generated CHO cells using an artificial gene expression system. The addition of various concentrations of inducer drugs to the culture medium allowed control of proliferation and transgene expression of the engineered CHO cells. Use of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, an antagonist of estrogen, as an inducing agent yielded high gene expression at a concentration more than 10-fold lower than that of β-estradiol. When scFv-Fc was produced under inducing conditions, continuous production was possible for more than 2 weeks while maintaining high specific productivity (57 pg cell<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> ). This artificial gene expression control system that utilizes the estrogen response of estrogen receptors can be an effective method for inducible production of biopharmaceuticals.",2023,12,31
High-efficiency extraction of target particles in viscoelastic contraction-expansion microchannels.,"The efficient and precise extraction of target particles is a crucial prerequisite for achieving accurate detection and analysis in microfluidic cell analysis. In this study, a symmetrical contraction-expansion microchannel with sheath flow was designed, aiming to extract target larger particles from particles of different sizes within the channel. This paper conducted numerical simulations to investigate the three-dimensional migration mechanisms of particles and performed experimental studies to examine the separation performance of particles with different sizes under varying flow rate ratios and different numbers of contraction-expansion structures. The experimental results indicate that at moderate sample flow rates and higher flow rate ratios, microchannels with fewer contraction-expansion structures are likely to achieve better performance in extracting target particles compared to microchannels with a greater number of these structures. Our work advances the application of viscoelastic contraction-expansion microchannels in particle separation. This device is easy to set up in parallel and significantly enhances throughput, providing an accurate and efficient solution for future particle separation applications.",2023,12,31

"An Ideal Molecular Construction Strategy for Ultra-Narrow-Band Deep-Blue Emitters: Balancing Bathochromic-Shift Emission, Spectral Narrowing, and Aggregation Suppression.","Narrowband emissive multiple resonance (MR) emitters promise high efficiency and stability in deep-blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the construction of ideal ultra-narrow-band deep-blue MR emitters still faces formidable challenges, especially in balancing bathochromic-shift emission, spectral narrowing, and aggregation suppression. Here, DICz is chosen, which possesses the smallest full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) in MR structures, as the core and solved the above issue by tuning its peripheral substitution sites. The 1-substituted molecule Cz-DICz is able to show a bright deep-blue emission with a peak at 457 nm, an extremely small FWHM of 14 nm, and a CIE coordinate of (0.14, 0.08) in solution. The corresponding OLEDs exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 22.1%-25.6% and identical small FWHMs of 18 nm over the practical mass-production concentration range (1-4 wt.%). To the best of the knowledge, 14 and 18 nm are currently the smallest FWHM values for deep-blue MR emitters with similar emission maxima under photoluminescence and electroluminescence conditions, respectively. These discoveries will help drive the development of high-performance narrowband deep-blue emitters and bring about a revolution in OLED industry.",2023,12,31
Antibody-Conjugated Magnetic Nanoparticle Therapy for Inhibiting T-Cell Mediated Inflammation.,"Tolerance induction is critical for mitigating T cell-mediated inflammation. Treatments based on anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) play a pivotal role in inducing such tolerance. Anti-CD3 mAb conjugated with dextran-coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) may induce inflammatory tolerance is posited. MNPs conjugated with anti-CD3 mAb (Ab-MNPs) are characterized using transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and their distribution is assessed using a nanoparticle tracking analyzer. Compared to MNPs, 90% of Ab-MNPs increased in size from 54.7 ± 0.5 to 71.7 ± 2.7 nm. The in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the therapeutic material as nontoxic and biocompatible. Mice are administered various dosages of Ab-MNPs before receiving concanavalin-A (ConA), an inflammation inducer. Preadministration of Ab-MNPs, as opposed to MNPs or anti-CD3 mAb alone, significantly reduced the serum levels of interferon-γ and interleukin-6 in ConA-treated mice. Additionally, the transdermal stamp patch as an effective delivery system for Ab-MNPs is validated. This study demonstrates the utility of the Ab-MNP complex in pathologies associated with T cell-mediated hyperinflammation, such as organ transplantation and COVID-19.",2023,12,31
A Paramagnetic Metal-Organic Framework Enhances Mild Magnetic Hyperthermia Therapy by Downregulating Heat Shock Proteins and Promoting Ferroptosis via Aggravation of Two-Way Regulated Redox Dyshomeostasis.,"Mild magnetic hyperthermia therapy (MMHT) holds great potential in treating deep-seated tumors, but its efficacy is impaired by the upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) during the treatment process. Herein, Lac-FcMOF, a lactose derivative (Lac-NH<sub>2</sub> ) modified paramagnetic metal-organic framework (FcMOF) with magnetic hyperthermia property and thermal stability, has been developed to enhance MMHT therapeutic efficacy. In vitro studies showed that Lac-FcMOF aggravates two-way regulated redox dyshomeostasis (RDH) via magnetothermal-accelerated ferricenium ions-mediated consumption of glutathione and ferrocene-catalyzed generation of ∙OH to induce oxidative damage and inhibit heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) synthesis, thus significantly enhancing the anti-cancer efficacy of MMHT. Aggravated RDH promotes glutathione peroxidase 4 inactivation and lipid peroxidation to promote ferroptosis, which further synergizes with MMHT. H22-tumor-bearing mice treated with Lac-FcMOF under alternating magnetic field (AMF) demonstrated a 90.4% inhibition of tumor growth. This work therefore provides a new strategy for the simple construction of a magnetic hyperthermia agent that enables efficient MMHT by downregulating HSPs and promoting ferroptosis through the aggravation of two-way regulated RDH.",2023,12,31
Unraveling Ros Conversion Through Enhanced Enzyme-Like Activity with Copper-Doped Cerium Oxide for Tumor Nanocatalytic Therapy.,"Nanozyme catalytic therapy for cancer treatments has become one of the heated topics, and the therapeutic efficacy is highly correlated with their catalytic efficiency. In this work, three copper-doped CeO<sub>2</sub> supports with various structures as well as crystal facets are developed to realize dual enzyme-mimic catalytic activities, that is superoxide dismutase (SOD) to reduce superoxide radicals to H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> and peroxidase (POD) to transform H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> to ∙OH. The wire-shaped CeO<sub>2</sub> /Cu-W has the richest surface oxygen vacancies, and a low level of oxygen vacancy (Vo) formation energy, which allows for the elimination of intracellular reactive oxygen spieces (ROS) and continuous transformation to ∙OH with cascade reaction. Moreover, the wire-shaped CeO<sub>2</sub> /Cu-W displays the highest toxic ∙OH production capacity in an acidic intracellular environment, inducing breast cancer cell death and pro-apoptotic autophagy. Therefore, wire-shaped CeO<sub>2</sub> /Cu nanoparticles as an artificial enzyme system can have great potential in the intervention of intracellular ROS in cancer cells, achieving efficacious nanocatalytic therapy.",2023,12,31

Unveiling foliar secreting sites and secretion composition in the legume tree Swartzia flaemingii Raddi.,"Secretory structures in plants play a crucial role in producing bioactive compounds. Despite the potential of the Swartzia genus, comprehensive studies in this context are still scarce. Swartzia is a legume tree (Fabaceae) that occurs in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a biodiversity hotspot, and includes species such as Swartzia flaemingii. Therefore, we aim to achieve: (1) identify and characterize the key secretory sites responsible for saponin production in S. flaemingii leaflets; (2) confirm the presence of saponins in S. flaemingii leaves by comparing them with known chemical profiles of other Swartzia species; (3) assess the potential hemolytic and cytotoxic effects of crude leaf extracts. Our investigation unveils the presence of phenolic idioblasts, mucilage cells, and articulate laticifers, which play pivotal roles in defense and adaptation. Notably, we report the first-ever ultrastructural details of laticifers in a legume species. Additionally, oleanane-type saponins were identified in the leaves, giving insights about the chemotaxonomic profile of Swartzia. The crude extracts show low cytotoxicity levels, showcasing as a promising alternative source of saponins. This investigation reinforces the importance of conserving plants in threatened regions like the Atlantic Forest, a global biodiversity hotspot facing substantial anthropogenic pressures.",2023,12,31
Supramolecular Hydrolase Mimics in Equilibrium and Kinetically Trapped States.,"The folding of proteins into intricate three-dimensional structures to achieve biological functions, such as catalysis, is governed by both kinetic and thermodynamic controls. The quest to design artificial enzymes using minimalist peptides seeks to emulate supramolecular structures existing in a catalytically active state. Drawing inspiration from the nuanced process of protein folding, our study explores the enzyme-like activity of amphiphilic peptide nanosystems in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium states, featuring the formation of supramolecular nanofibrils and nanosheets. In contrast to thermodynamically stable nanosheets, the kinetically trapped nanofibrils exhibit dynamic characteristics (e.g., rapid molecular exchange and relatively weak intermolecular packing), resulting in a higher hydrolase-mimicking activity. We emphasize that a supramolecular microenvironment characterized by an optimal local polarity, microviscosity and β-sheet hydrogen bonding is conducive to both substrate binding and ester bond hydrolysis. Our work underscores the pivotal role of both thermodynamic and kinetic control in impacting biomimetic catalysis and sheds a light on the development of artificial enzymes.",2023,12,31

A novel iPSC model reveals selective vulnerability of neurons in multiple sulfatase deficiency.,"Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) is an ultra-rare, inherited lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the gene sulfatase modifying factor 1 (SUMF1). MSD is characterized by the functional deficiency of all sulfatase enzymes, leading to the storage of sulfated substrates including glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), sulfolipids, and steroid sulfates. Patients with MSD experience severe neurological impairment, hearing loss, organomegaly, corneal clouding, cardiac valve disease, dysostosis multiplex, contractures, and ichthyosis. Here, we generated a novel human model of MSD by reprogramming patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells to establish an MSD induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line (SUMF1 p.A279V). We also generated an isogenic control iPSC line by correcting the pathogenic variant with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. We successfully differentiated these iPSC lines into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and NGN2-induced neurons (NGN2-iN) to model the neuropathology of MSD. Mature neuronal cells exhibited decreased SUMF1 gene expression, increased lysosomal stress, impaired neurite outgrowth and maturation, reduced sulfatase activities, and GAG accumulation. Interestingly, MSD iPSCs and NPCs did not exhibit as severe of phenotypes, suggesting that as neurons differentiate and mature, they become more vulnerable to loss of SUMF1. In summary, we demonstrate that this human iPSC-derived neuronal model recapitulates the cellular and biochemical features of MSD. These cell models can be used as tools to further elucidate the mechanisms of MSD pathology and for the development of therapeutics.",2023,12,21
A model to enhance breast cancer screening among rural women aged 40-75 years in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA): A scoping review.,It is claimed that very little research has been done in Africa on breast cancer screening to identify the best method that can be adopted to have early detection of the malignancy. Breast cancer is a growing burden globally and in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). There is a rise in breast cancer mortality in SSA. This is caused by limited breast cancer screening or early detection practices due to limited resources which makes mammography unaffordable by the majority of women. This problem is more prevalent in elderly women living in rural areas where limited or no breast cancer screening is taking place. Downstaging which is context-specific is recommended for African countries but more studies are required to confirm its effectiveness.,2023,12,30
Treatment Patterns and Real-World Outcomes for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer in the Era of Immunotherapy.,There are limited data on real-world outcomes for patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) since immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) became available.

The history of deep brain stimulation.,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery is an established and effective treatment for several movement disorders (tremor, Parkinson's disease, and dystonia), and is under investigation in numerous other neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the origins and development of this neurofunctional technique are not always well understood and recognized. In this mini-review, we review the history of DBS, highlighting important milestones and the most remarkable protagonists (neurosurgeons, neurologists, and neurophysiologists) who pioneered and fostered this therapy throughout the 20th and early 21st century. Alongside DBS historical markers, we also briefly discuss newer developments in the field, and the future challenges which accompany such progress.",2023,12,25

Duodenal and pancreatic tissue microbiome profiles of PPI users and non-users.,"Factors that influence the pancreas microbiome are not well understood. Regular proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use induces significant alterations in the gut microbiome, including an increase in the abundance of Streptococcus, and may be associated with pancreatic cancer risk. The aim of this study was to examine whether PPI use is associated with pancreatic and duodenal tissue microbiomes. We compared 16S rRNA microbiome profiles of normal pancreatic and duodenal tissue from 103 patients undergoing pancreatic surgery for non-malignant indications, including 34 patients on PPIs, accounting for factors including age, smoking, body mass index and the presence of main pancreatic duct dilation. Histologically normal tissue from the pancreatic head had higher alpha diversity and enrichment of Firmicutes by phylum-level analysis and Streptococcus species compared to normal pancreas body/tail tissues (16.8 % vs 8.8 %, P = .02, and 5.9 % vs 1.4 %, P = .03, respectively). Measures of beta diversity differed significantly between the pancreas and the duodenum, but in subjects with main pancreatic duct dilation, beta diversity of pancreatic head tissue was more similar to normal duodenal tissue than those without pancreatic duct dilation. Duodenal tissue of PPI users had significant enrichment of Firmicute phyla (34.7 % vs. 14.1 %, P = .01) and Streptococcus genera (19.5 % vs. 5.2 %, P = .01) compared to non-users; these differences were not evident in pancreas tissues. By multivariate analysis, PPI use was associated with alpha diversity in the duodenum, but not in the pancreas. However, some differences in pancreas tissue beta diversity were observed between PPI users and non-users. In summary, we find differences in the microbiome profiles of the pancreas head versus the pancreatic body/tail and we find PPI use is associated with alterations in duodenal and pancreatic tissue microbiome profiles.",2023,12,27
Machine Learning and CT Texture Features in Ex-smokers with no CT Evidence of Emphysema and Mildly Abnormal Diffusing Capacity.,"Ex-smokers without spirometry or CT evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but with mildly abnormal diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DL<sub>CO</sub>) are at higher risk of developing COPD. It remains difficult to make clinical management decisions for such ex-smokers without other objective assessments consistent with COPD. Hence, our objective was to develop a machine-learning and CT texture-analysis pipeline to dichotomize ex-smokers with normal and abnormal DL<sub>CO</sub> (DL<sub>CO</sub>≥75%<sub>pred</sub> and DL<sub>CO</sub><75%<sub>pred</sub>).",2023,12,30

Preparation of polylactic acid reinforced with cellulose nanofibers toward photochromic self-healing adhesive for anti-counterfeiting applications.,"There are a number of drawbacks with photochromic adhesives, including their poor durability, high price tag, and lackluster performance. On the other hand, self-healable adhesives have shown to be durable and robust than conventional alternatives. Hydrogel adhesives that change color in response to ultraviolet light were created for usage in self-healable authenticating stamps. In this context, a combination of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), polylactic acid (PLA) and nanoparticles of lanthanide aluminate (NLA) were prepared to generate an organic-inorganic hybrid hydrogel adhesive with self-healing properties. NLA agglomerates were avoided due to the use of CNFs as a nanofiller and dispersion agent. Colorless stamps require that NLA to be dispersed consistently in the CNFs/PLA hydrogel without clumping. This film becomes green when irradiated with ultraviolet, as indicated by luminescence spectra and CIE Lab coordinates. When illuminated at 365 nm, the paper sheets emitted light with a wavelength of 519 nm. The morphologies of prints were analyzed by different analytical methods. Diameter measurements from a transmission electron microscope (TEM) of the synthesized NLA ranged from 5 to 9 nm, whereas CNFs displayed diameters of 40-60 nm. The current NLA@CNFs/PLA hydrogel presents a reliable anti-counterfeiting solution for various authenticating products.",2023,12,29
Effect of hydrochloric acid and citric acid with ultrasound processing on characteristics of superfine-ground pectic polysaccharides from okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.) peel.,"The structural properties and biological activities of okra pectic polysaccharides (OPs) were impacted by various extraction methods. Based on commonly grinding (40, 100 meshes) and superfine grinding okra powders, two extraction solvents (hydrochloric acid, HA; citric acid, CA) were used firstly. Next, the extraction yield, physical and chemical properties, molecular structure and functional properties of OPs were analyzed by non-ultrasonic treatment and ultrasound-assisted superfine grinding method. The outcomes demonstrated that the extraction yield of OPs rose as the particle size of the powder decreased. HA-OPs had higher molecular weight (Mw), apparent viscosity and emulsification ability than CA-OPs. CA-OPs had higher esterification degree (DE), solubility and total sugar content, and higher amounts of rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) segments. Compared with OPs without ultrasound-assisted extraction, ultrasound-assisted superfine grinding extraction exhibited higher sugar content, antioxidant capacity, emulsification ability, lower Mw, DE and apparent viscosity. Finally, the correlation between structure and function of OPs was further quantified. The antioxidant capacity was positively correlated with RG-I content, and negatively correlated with DE and Mw. The emulsification ability was mainly positively correlated with the GlcA of OPs. This study provides a theoretical basis for the development of OPs foods with clear structure-function relationship, which would be instructive for the application of OPs in food and cosmetics.",2023,12,29
Tannic acid and carboxymethyl chitosan-based multi-functional double-layered hydrogel with pH-stimulated response behavior for smart real-time infection monitoring and wound treatment.,"The dramatic increase of drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria has seriously effect on human health, appealing the needs of developing theranostic platforms with stimuli-responsive materials to realize the accurate bacterial diagnostics and therapeutics. Herein, a tannic acid and carboxymethyl chitosan-based multifunctional ZIF-90@i-PPOPs-phenol red double-layered hydrogel with stimuli-responsiveness and antibacterial activity was fabricated. The inner layer hydrogel (ZIF-90@i-PPOPs-based TFC hydrogels) was fabricated based on ZIF-90@i-PPOPs, integrate tannic acid and carboxymethyl chitosan linked by formylphenylboronic acid (FPBA), which exhibited outstanding injectable, biodegradability and antibacterial activity. The outer layer hydrogel (PR@PAM hydrogels) were constructed from polyacrylamide (PAM) and pH indicator phenol red, owning porous structure and excellent tissue adhesion. Due to the weakly acidic microenvironment within wound, the inner-layer hydrogel was stimulus-responsively decomposed, resulting in the accurate delivery of the positively charged ZIF-90@i-PPOPs to the lesion site to capture and kill bacteria by enhanced Zn<sup>2+</sup> and ROS release. Meantime, the outer-layer hydrogel could real-timely monitor the pH changes to evaluate the wound recovery status. These double-layered hydrogels possessed precisely pH monitoring capacity, excellent antibacterial ability and negligible side effect to normal tissue in vivo, implying the high potential of the suggested hydrogels as theranostic platform for antibacterial treatment.",2023,12,29
Chitosan-chelated carbon dots-based nanozyme of extreme stability with super peroxidase activity and antibacterial ability for wound healing.,"Bacterial infection often leads to failed wound healing, causing one-third of death cases globally. However, antibacterial nanomaterials and natural enzymes face limitations including low antibacterial efficiency, lack of catalytic performance, low safety, and instability. Therefore, a new Fe/N-doped chitosan-chelated carbon dot-based nanozyme CS@Fe-N CDs was developed, which showed multiple advantages such as highly efficient antibacterial activity, excellent peroxidase-like activity, high stability, and high biocompatibility, shortening the wound healing time. The ultra-small (6.14 ± 3.38 nm) CS@Fe-N CDs nanozyme accelerated the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to ·OH conversion, exhibiting excellent antibacterial performance against Staphylococcus aureus. The antibacterial activity was increased by over 2000-fold after catalysis. The CS@Fe-N CDs nanozyme also displayed outstanding peroxidase activity (V<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> = 1.77 × 10<sup>-6</sup>/s), 8.8-fold higher than horseradish peroxidase. Additionally, the CS@Fe-N CDs nanozyme exhibited high stability at broad pH values (pH 1-12) and temperature ranges (20-90 °C). In vitro evaluation of cell toxicity proved that the CS@Fe-N CDs nanozyme had negligible cytotoxicity. In vivo, wound healing experiments demonstrated that the CS@Fe-N CDs could shorten the healing time of rat wounds by at least 4 days, and even had a better curative effect than penicillin. In conclusion, this therapeutic platform provides an effective antibacterial and biologically safe healing strategy for skin wounds.",2023,12,30
Alginate-modified surfactants functionalized metal-organic framework-based fluorescent film sensors for detection and adsorption of volatile aldehydes in water.,"Volatile aldehydes have an adverse impact on both human health and the environment, therefore, a fast, straightforward, highly accurate detection technique for the simultaneous detection and removal of several aldehydes is eagerly anticipated. Herein, novel APGF@ZIF-8 and APOF@ZIF-8 sensing materials were developed by coating fluorescent alginate-modified surfactants (APGF and APOF) into the ZIF-8 MOFs to produce quite porous fluorescent sensors (S<sub>BET</sub> up to 1519 m<sup>2</sup>/g). The detection capacity of the prepared sensors for benzaldehyde, glyoxal, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde has been examined. The detection mechanism was suggested as hydrogen bonding formation between the sensors and volatile aldehydes as confirmed by Gaussian calculations. All the fluorescence spectra of aldehydes display remarkable linear detection relationships in the range of 0.05-200 μM with the limits of detection (LOD) values in the range of 0.001-0.18 μM (0.106-10.44 ppb). These sensors were utilized successfully to detect multiple volatile aldehydes in river water samples with satisfactory recoveries of 96-107 %. Interestingly, fluorescent APGF@ZIF-8/CS and APOF@ZIF-8/CS films as portable disposable removal techniques for benzaldehyde, glyoxal, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde from water were fabricated. APOF@ZIF-8/CS exhibited an excellent formaldehyde adsorption capacity of 58.30 mg/g and an adsorption removal efficiency of 93.5 %. The adsorption process of biosorbent on various aldehydes was fitted by Freundlich adsorption isotherm. The adsorption kinetics followed Pseudo-second-order kinetic model.",2023,12,29
Microwave-assisted extraction of cellulose and aromatic compounds from rose petals based on deep eutectic solvent.,"High-value utilization of agricultural wastes such as rose petals promotes the development of the dual carbon economy. In this study, rose petals were pretreated by microwave-assisted deep eutectic solvent (DES). Choline chloride-ethylene glycol (ChCl-EG) was used as the basis for the addition of P-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) or Ferric chloride (FeCl<sub>3</sub>). Forming ternary DESs, as well as designing quaternary DESs with a synergistic effect. The effects of different types of multicomponent DES on treating anthocyanins, cellulose, and lignin in rose flowers were explored. The results showed that the highest anthocyanin extraction of 173.71 mg/g and the highest lignin removal of 40.80 % could be achieved after tetrad DES pretreatment when the molar ratio was ChCl:EG:TsOH:FeCl<sub>3</sub> = 1:2:0.3:0.3. The interaction energy between anthocyanins and DES was calculated using density functional theory (DFT), and the maximum was -543.14 kcal/mol. This study demonstrated that DES pretreatment can provide novel insights for the utilization of roses in high-value.",2023,12,30
Uncovering the dominant role of root lignin accumulation in silicon-induced resistance to drought in tomato.,"The role of lignin accumulation in silicon-induced resistance has not been fully elucidated. Based on the finding that the root cell wall is protected by silicon, this study explored the role of lignin accumulation in silicon-induced drought resistance in tomato. The decreased silicon concentration of the root confirmed the dominant role of lignin accumulation in silicon-induced drought resistance. The lignin monomer content in the root was enhanced by silicon, and was accompanied by the enhancement of drought resistance. Histochemical and transcriptional analyses of lignin showed that lignin accumulation was promoted by silicon under drought stress. In addition, in the root zone, silicon-induced lignin accumulation increased as the distance from the root tip increased under drought stress. Surprisingly, the Dwarf gene was upregulated by silicon in the roots. Micro Tom Dwarf gene mutation and Micro Tom-d + Dwarf gene functional complementation were further used to confirm that Dwarf regulates the spatial accuracy of SHR expression in the root. Therefore, root lignin accumulation plays a dominant role in silicon-induced drought resistance in tomato and the regulation of spatial accuracy of root lignification by silicon under drought stress is through the BR pathway, thereby avoiding the inhibition of root growth caused by root lignification.",2023,12,29
Adding a Small Field of View for Increased Resolution in Contouring: An Effective and Quick Method.,"Image resolution is paramount when contouring complex anatomy, as in head & neck planning. It is notable that when diagnostic radiologists perform a CT scan of the neck, they always use a small field of view (SFOV) because it gives the best image resolution. When planning for radiation treatment, however, it is also necessary to have a large field of view (LFOV) in order to provide a comprehensive external contour that allows for radiation dose calculation. Here we present a simple method to obtain both a SFOV and LFOV at the time of CT simulation.",2023,12,29
Deep brain stimulation with short versus conventional pulse width in Parkinson's disease and essential tremor: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To maximize clinical benefit and minimize stimulation-induced side effects, optimising deep brain stimulation (DBS) parameters is paramount.

Question-based review for pharmaceutical development: An enhanced quality approach.,"Over the last years, the pharmaceutical industry has faced real challenges regarding quality assurance. In this context, the establishment of more holistic approaches to the pharmaceutical development has been encouraged. The emergence of the Quality by Design (QbD) paradigm as systematic, scientific and risk-based methodology introduced a new concept of pharmaceutical quality. In essence, QbD can be interpreted as a strategy to maximize time and cost savings. An in-depth understanding of the formulation and manufacturing process is demanded to optimize the safety, efficacy and quality of a drug product at all stages of development. This innovative approach streamlines the pharmaceutical Research and Development (R&D) process, provides greater manufacturing flexibility and reduces regulatory burden. To assist in QbD implementation, International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) organized and launched QbD principles in their guidance for industry, identifying key concepts and tools to design and develop a high-quality drug product. Despite the undeniable advantages of the QbD approach, and the widespread information on QbD regulatory expectations, its full implementation in the pharmaceutical field is still limited. The present review aims to establish a crosswise overview on the current application status of QbD within the framework of the ICH guidelines (ICH Q8(R2) - Q14 and ICH Q2(R2)). Moreover, it outlines the way information gathered from the QbD methodology is being harmonized in Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) for European market approval. This work also highlights the challenges that hinder the deployment of the QbD strategy as a standard practice.",2023,12,29
Endometriosis and Mental Health Disorders: identification and treatment as part of a multimodal approach.,"Endometriosis is a disease marked by more than pain and infertility, as it transcends the well characterized physical symptoms to be frequently associated with mental health issues. This review focuses on the associations between endometriosis and anxiety, depression, sexual dysfunction, and eating disorders, all of which show a higher prevalence in women with the disease. Studies show that pain, but especially the chronic pelvic pain of endometriosis, likely serves as a mediating factor. Recent studies evaluating genetic predispositions for endometriosis and mental health disorders suggest a shared genetic predisposition. Health care providers who treat women with endometriosis should be aware of these associations in order to best treat their patients. A holistic approach to care by gynecologists as well as mental health professionals should emphasize prompt diagnosis, targeted medical interventions, psychological support, while also recognizing the role of supportive relationships in improving the patients' quality of life.",2023,12,29
Hippocampal and gut AMPK activation attenuates enterocolitis-like symptoms and co-occurring depressive-like behavior in ulcerative colitis model mice: Involvement of brain-gut autophagy.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease, have a high incidence of psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanism remains unknown. Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mice, a model of UC, exhibit depressive-like behavior and reduced adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, which regulates various physiological functions in the brain and gut. However, comprehensive studies on UC pathophysiology with co-occurring depression focused on brain-gut AMPK activity are lacking. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether resveratrol (RES), an AMPK activator, prevented DSS-induced UC-like symptoms and depressive-like behavior. DSS treatment induced UC-like pathology and depressive-like behavior, as assessed via the tail suspension test. Moreover, western blotting and immunohistochemical studies revealed that DSS increased p-p70S6 kinase (Thr389), p62, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), cleaved caspase-1, cleaved Gasdermin-D (GSDMD), and cleaved caspase-3 expression levels in the rectum and hippocampus, and increased CD40, iNOS, and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 expression levels, and the number of Iba1-positive cells in the hippocampus, and decreased p-AMPK and LC3II/I expression levels, and the number of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-positive cells, and reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus. These changes were reversed by the RES administration. RES also enhanced PGC1α and SOD1 expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated male mice. Moreover, NLRP3 staining was observed in the neurons and microglia, and cleaved GSDMD staining in neurons in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice. Notably, RES prevented UC-like pathology and depressive-like behavior and enhancement of autophagy, decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and inflammasome, and induced the Nrf2-PGC1α-SOD1 pathway in the hippocampus, resulting in neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Our findings suggest that brain-gut AMPK activation may be an important therapeutic strategy in patients with UC and depression.",2023,12,30
Benign-by-design plant extract-mediated preparation of copper oxide nanoparticles for environmentally related applications.,"A facile, cost-competitive, scalable and novel synthetic approach is used to prepare copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NPs) using Betel leaf (Piper betle) extracts as reducing, capping, and stabilizing agents. CuO-NPs were characterized using various analytical techniques, including Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), as well as photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The activity of CuO-NPs was investigated towards Congo red dye degradation, supercapacitor energy storage and antibacterial activity. A maximum of 89% photodegradation of Congo red dye (CR) was obtained. The nanoparticle modified electrode also exhibited a specific capacitance (C<sub>sp</sub>) of 179 Fg<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, the antibacterial potential of CuO NPs was evaluated against Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, both strains displaying high antibacterial performance.",2023,12,29
Production of light olefins and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from the pyrolysis of waste plastic straws over high-silica zeolite-based catalysts.,"Owing to the ever-increasing generation of plastic waste, the need to develop environmentally friendly disposal methods has increased. This study explored the potential of waste plastic straw to generate valuable light olefins and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) via catalytic pyrolysis using high-silica zeolite-based catalysts. HZSM-5 (SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:200) exhibited superior performance, yielding more light olefins (49.8 wt%) and a higher MAH content than Hbeta (300). This was attributed to the increased acidity and proper shape selectivity. HZSM-5 displayed better coking resistance (0.7 wt%) than Hbeta (4.4 wt%) by impeding secondary reactions, limiting coke precursor formation. The use of HZSM-5 (80) resulted in higher MAHs and lower light olefins than HZSM-5 (200) because of its higher acidity. Incorporation of Co into HZSM-5 (200) marginally lowered light olefin yield (to 44.0 wt%) while notably enhancing MAH production and boosting propene selectivity within the olefin composition. These observations are attributed to the well-balanced coexistence of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, which stimulated the carbonium ion mechanism and induced H-transfer, cyclization, Diels-alder, and dehydrogenation reactions. The catalytic pyrolysis of plastic straw over high-silica and metal-loaded HZSM-5 catalysts has been suggested as an efficient and sustainable method for transforming plastic waste materials into valuable light olefins and MAHs.",2023,12,29
Solar photovoltaic panel production in Mexico: A novel machine learning approach.,"This study examines the potential for widespread solar photovoltaic panel production in Mexico and emphasizes the country's unique qualities that position it as a strong manufacturing candidate in this field. An advanced model based on artificial neural networks has been developed to predict solar photovoltaic panel plant metrics. This model integrates a state-of-the-art non-linear programming framework using Pyomo as well as an innovative optimization and machine learning toolkit library. This approach creates surrogate models for individual photovoltaic plants including production timelines. While this research, conducted through extensive simulations and meticulous computations, unveiled that Latin America has been significantly underrepresented in the production of silicon, wafers, cells, and modules within the global market; it also demonstrates the substantial potential of scaling up photovoltaic panel production in Mexico, leading to significant economic, social, and environmental benefits. By hyperparameter optimization, an outstanding and competitive artificial neural network model has been developed with a coefficient of determination values above 0.99 for all output variables. It has been found that water and energy consumption during PV panel production is remarkable. However, water consumption (33.16 × 10<sup>-4</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/kWh) and the emissions generated (1.12 × 10<sup>-6</sup> TonCO<sub>2</sub>/kWh) during energy production are significantly lower than those of conventional power plants. Notably, the results highlight a positive economic trend, with module production plants generating the highest profits (35.7%) among all production stages, while polycrystalline silicon production plants yield comparatively lower earnings (13.0%). Furthermore, this study underscores a critical factor in the photovoltaic panel production process which is that cell production plants contribute the most to energy consumption (39.7%) due to their intricate multi-stage processes. The blending of Machine Learning and optimization models heralds a new era in resource allocation for a more sustainable renewable energy sector, offering a brighter, greener future.",2023,12,29
Synthesis and properties of nano-cadmium oxide and its size-dependent responses by barley plant.,"Present study included technological methods that made it possible to synthesize CdO nanoparticles and carry out their qualitative and quantitative diagnostics, confirming the as-prepared CdO nanoparticles (NPs) were spherical and had a size of 25 nm. Then, under the conditions of the model experiment the effect of CdO in macro and nanosized particles on absorption, transformation, and structural and functional changes occurring in cells and tissues of Hordeum vulgare L. (spring barley) during its ontogenesis was analyzed. Different analytical techniques were used to detect the transformation of CdO forms: Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDXMA and TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray absorption fine structure, consists of XANES - X-ray absorption near edge structure, and EXAFS - Extended X-ray absorption fine structure. Quantitative differences in the elemental chemical composition of barley root and leaf samples were observed. The predominant root uptake of Cd was revealed. CdO-NPs were found to penetrate deeply into barley plant tissues, where they accumulated and formed new mineral phases such as Cd<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl and CdSO<sub>4</sub> according to XRD analysis. The molecular-structural state of the local Cd environment in plant samples corresponding to Cd-O and Cd-Cd. The toxicity of CdO-NPs was found to significantly affect the morphology of intracellular structures are the main organelles of photosynthesis therefore, destructive changes in them obviously reduce the level of metabolic processes ensuring the growth of plants. This study is an attempt to show results how it is possible to combine some instrumental techniques to characterize and behavior of NPs in complex matrices of living organisms.",2023,12,29
Investigating the spatial distribution of volatile organic compounds in aircraft cabins from various emission sources.,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) significantly affect the air quality in aircraft cabins, consequently affecting passenger health and comfort. Although VOC emission sources and their contributions have been studied extensively, the distribution characteristics of VOCs originating from diverse sources within cabins have received limited attention, and the correlation between VOC sources and concentrations in passenger breathing zones remains largely unexplored. To fill this knowledge gap, the concentration field of VOCs was investigated using a computational fluid dynamics model, and the results were experimentally validated in a typical single-aisle aircraft cabin with seven seat rows. The diffusion characteristics of different VOCs emitted by four typical sources in aircraft cabins (floors, human surfaces, seats, and respiratory sources) were analyzed and compared. The distribution of VOCs emitted by different sources was nonuniform and could be classified into two distinct categories. When the emission intensities of all sources were equal, the average concentration of VOCs emitted from the floor source were considerably lower in the passenger breathing zone (4.01 μg/m³) than those emitted from the human surface, seat, and respiratory sources, which exhibited approximately equal concentrations (6.82, 6.90, and 7.29 μg/m³, respectively). The analysis highlighted that the simplified lumped-parameter method could not accurately estimate the exposure concentrations within an aircraft cabin. To address this issue, we propose a correction method based on the emission intensity of each VOC source. This study provides critical insights into the diffusion characteristics of VOCs within aircraft cabins and VOC emissions from various sources.",2023,12,29
Catalytic removal of gaseous pollutant NO using CO: Catalyst structure and reaction mechanism.,"Carbon monoxide (CO) has recently been considered an ideal reducing agent to replace NH<sub>3</sub> in selective catalytic reduction of NO<sub>x</sub> (NH<sub>3</sub>-SCR). This shift is particularly relevant in diesel engines, coal-fired industry, the iron and steel industry, of which generate substantial amounts of CO due to incomplete combustion. Developing high-performance catalysts remain a critical challenge for commercializing this technology. The active sites on catalyst surface play a crucial role in the various microscopic reaction steps of this reaction. This work provides a comprehensive overview and insights into the reaction mechanism of active sites on transition metal- and noble metal-based catalysts, including the types of intermediates and active sites, as well as the conversion mechanism of active molecules or atoms. In addition, the effects of factors such as O<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and alkali metals, on NO reduction by CO were discussed, and the prospects for catalyst design are proposed. It is hoped to provide theoretical guidance for the rational design of efficient CO selective catalytic denitration materials based on the structure-activity relations.",2023,12,29
Development of innovative and green adsorbents for in situ cleanup of fluoride-polluted groundwater: Mechanisms and field-scale studies.,"In this study, the magnesium oxide (MgO)-based adsorbents [granulated MgO aggregates (GA-MgO) and surface-modified MgO powder (SM-MgO)] were developed to remediate a fluoride-contaminated groundwater site. Both GA-MgO and SM-MgO had porous, spherical, and crystalline structures. Diameters for GA-MgO and SM-MgO were 1-1.7 mm and 1-10 μm, respectively. The pseudo second-order dynamic adsorption and the Freundlich isotherm could be applied to express the chemical adsorption phenomena. The monolayer adsorption was the dominant mechanism at the initial adsorption period. During the latter part of fluoride adsorption, the multilayer adsorption became the dominant mechanism for fluoride removal from the water phase, which also resulted in the increased adsorption capacity. Higher hydroxide, phosphate, and carbonate concentrations caused a decreased fluoride removal efficiency due to the competition of sorption sites between fluoride and other anions with similar electronic properties. Fluoride removal mechanism using GA-MgO and SM-MgO as the adsorbents was mainly carried out by the chemical adsorption. Reaction paths contained two main processes: (1) formation of magnesium hydroxide after the reaction of MgO with water, and (2) the hydroxyl group of the magnesium hydroxide was replaced by fluoride ions to form magnesium fluoride precipitation. Results from column tests show that up to 61 and 73% of fluoride removal (initial fluoride concentration = 9.3 mg/L) could be obtained after 50 pore volumes of groundwater pumping with GA-MgO and SM-MgO injection, respectively. The GA-MgO system could be applied to contain and remediate fluoride-contaminated groundwater, and SM-MgO could be applied as an immediate fluoride removal alternative to achieve a rapid pollutant removal for emergency responses. Up to 71% of fluoride removal (fluoride concentration = 10.8 mg/L) could be obtained with GA-MgO injection after 30 days of operation. The developed GA-MgO system is a potential and green remediation alternative to contain the fluoride plume significantly.",2023,12,29
Spatial variation and chemical reactivity of dusts from open-pit bitumen mining using trace elements in snow.,"The chemical reactivity of trace elements (TEs) in dusts from bitumen mining, upgrading and related industrial activities in the Athabasca Bituminous Sands region (ABS), Alberta, Canada, was evaluated using the acid-soluble fraction of snow. Samples were collected at 14 sites along the Athabasca River (AR) and its tributaries, and at 3 remote locations. Following metal-free, ultra-clean procedures for processing and analysis, samples were leached with nitric acid (pH < 1), filtered (<0.45 μm), and analyzed using ICP-MS. Insoluble particles (>0.45 μm) were examined using SEM-EDS. Along the river, acid-soluble concentrations of TEs varied by 6 orders of magnitude, from 1 mg/L (Al) to less than 1 ng/L (Tl). Conservative (Al, Y, La, Th) and mobile (Li, Be, Cs, Sr) lithophile elements, those enriched in bitumen (V, Ni, Mo), and potentially toxic chalcophile elements (As, Cd, Pb, Sb, Tl) showed considerable spatial variation. Normalizing the concentrations of TEs in samples collected near industry to the corresponding concentrations in snow from the reference site (UTK), resulted in enrichments of V and most of the lithophile elements. Dust reactivity, quantified as the ratio of acid-soluble to total concentrations, was less than 50% suggesting limited bioaccessibility. The large differences in behaviour between Cd and Pb versus Ni and V could be due to the occurrence of the former pair in carbonate or sulfide minerals, versus acid-insoluble petcoke particles for the latter couple. Spatial variations in the reactivity of TEs most likely reflect the range in diversity and chemical stability of dust particles, and variations in their abundance in primary source areas. The leaching conditions employed here are extreme (pH < 1) and intended to identify an upper limit of chemical reactivity, with far less dust dissolution expected when these dusts encounter natural waters of the area which range in pH from 4 to 8.",2023,12,29
"The occurrence characteristics, removal efficiency, and risk assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in sewage sludges from across China.","Sewage sludge is considered to be an important sink for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in wastewater treatment plants and the potential risks from sludge contaminated with PAHs during land application has attracted attention. To identify the priority PAHs for control and enhance their removal from sludge, the occurrence characteristics, removal efficiency, and risk assessment of PAHs in sewage sludges from across China were analyzed. Data collection was from 2001 to 2023. Results showed that 16 PAHs were widely detected in Chinese sewage sludge with total amounts (∑16PAHs) between 0.06 and 34.93 mg kg dw<sup>-1</sup>. Fossil fuel, coal, and biomass combustion are main anthropogenic sources of PAHs in China. In general, phenanthrene (PHE), anthracene (ANT), fluorescein (FL), chrysene (CHR), pyrene (PYR), and benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF) are regarded as the main components and PAHs with 3-5 rings dominate (84.01%-91.53%) sewage sludge in China. Although aerobic composting and anaerobic treatment significantly improve ∑16PAHs removal, sludge stabilization treatment only reduced the risk by a small amount, especially for high-molecular-weight (HMW) PAHs. The benzo[a]anthracene (BaA), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and dibenzo[a,h]anthracene (DahA) are proposed as the priority control contaminants for sewage sludge in China because they have consistently high-risk quotient (RQ) values of 2.42-7.47, 1.28-3.16, 1.06-1.83 before and after sludge stabilization, respectively. More attention should be paid to BaA, BbF, benzo[k]fluoranthene (BkF), BaP, DahA, and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (IcdP) in Beijing; ANT, BaA, and BaP in Shanghai; and BaA and BaP in Guanghzou. Although the toxic equivalent quotient (TEQ) for PAHs met the limit concentration requirements of the national standard, the potential health risks due to long-term exposure to HMW PAHs cannot be ignored because the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) was consistently in the risk threshold range (>1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Some suggestions on enhanced treatment approaches and land use standards are proposed to further alleviate the risk from HMW PAHs.",2023,12,29
"Particulate matter from a tropical city in southeast Brazil: Impact of biomass burning on polycyclic aromatic compounds levels, health risks, and in vitro toxicity.","In the context of a rising global temperature, biomass burning represents an increasing risk to human health, due to emissions of highly toxic substances such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs). Size-segregated particulate matter (PM) was collected in a region within the sugarcane belt of São Paulo state (Brazil), where biomass burning is still frequent, despite the phasing out of manual harvesting preceded by fire. The median of the total concentration of the 15 PAHs determined was 2.3 ± 1.8 ng m<sup>-3</sup> (n = 19), where 63% of this content was in PM<sub>1.0</sub>. Concentrations of OPAHs and NPAHs were about an order of magnitude lower. PM<sub>2.5</sub> collected in the dry season, when most of the fires occur, presented PAHs and OPAHs total concentrations three times higher than in the wet season, showing positive correlations with fire foci number and levoglucosan (a biomass burning marker). These results, added to the fact that biomass burning explained 65% of the data variance (PCA analysis), evidenced the importance of this practice as a source of PAHs and OPAHs to the regional atmosphere. Conversely, NPAHs appeared to be mainly derived from diesel-powered vehicles. The B[a]P equivalent concentration was estimated to be 4 times higher in the dry season than in the wet season, and was greatly increased during a local fire event. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of PM<sub>1.0</sub> organic extracts were assessed using in vitro tests with human liver HepG2 cells. For both types of tests, significant toxicity was only observed for samples collected during the dry season. Persistent DNA damage that may have impaired the DNA repair system was also observed. The results indicated that there was a health risk associated with the air particulate mixture, mainly related to biomass burning, demonstrating the urgent need for better remediation actions to prevent the occurrence of burning events.",2023,12,29
"Surveillance imaging strategies for pituitary adenomas: when, how frequent and when to stop.","Magnetic resonance imaging is the mainstay imaging modality of choice in the assessment, treatment planning and follow-up of pituitary adenomas (PAs). Pituitary adenomas are discovered incidentally during imaging for a variety of unrelated conditions, because of clinical symptoms related to mass effects on the adjacent structures, or during work up for functional alterations of the adenoma. Imaging is also utilized in the preoperative and postoperative phases of assessment of PAs, for surgical and radiotherapy planning, for postoperative surveillance to assess for adenoma stability and detection of adenoma recurrence, and for surveillance to monitor for adenoma growth in unoperated PAs. Currently, because there are no evidence-based consensus recommendations, the optimal strategy for surveillance imaging of PAs is not clearly established. Younger age, initial adenoma size, extra-sellar extension, mass effect, cavernous sinus invasion, functional status, histopathologic characteristics, cost considerations, imaging accessibility, patient preference and patient contraindications (e.g., implanted metallic devices and patient claustrophobia) are all important factors that influences the strategy for surveillance imaging. This review focuses on when to image, how often to perform imaging, and when to stop imaging PAs. Due to the lack of evidence pertaining to the natural history of many PAs, the recommendations provided are largely expert-opinion based and should be individualized based on clinical presentation, history, adenoma morphology on imaging and histopathologic characteristics.",2023,12,29

Infective Endocarditis Complicated with a Large Left Coronary Cusp Aneurysm: A Condition with Undefined Natural History and Treatment.,"The natural history and treatment of an aortic cusp aneurysm with or without rupture due to native aortic valve infective endocarditis (NAV-IE) have not been well defined. This may explain why current guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease do not include this complication as an indication for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or repair or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We describe herein the first case of a 76-year-old man with multiple comorbidities with a NAV-IE associated large left coronary cusp aneurysm with subsequent rupture and consequent severe aortic regurgitation (AR) and heart failure for which he underwent an off label successful TAVR. This patient's scenario suggests that a cusp aneurysm due to NAV-IE poses high risk for subsequent rupture, severe AR, and heart failure. In conclusion, TAVR may be a reasonable alternative to high risk SAVR in patients with NAV-IE associated cusp aneurysms with or without but impending rupture.",2023,12,30

The evolutionary adaptation of shrimp hemocyanin subtypes and the consequences on their structure and functions.,"Hemocyanin is the main respiratory protein of arthropods and is formed by hexameric and/or oligomeric subunits. Due to changes in the living environment and gene rearrangement, various hemocyanin subtypes and subunits evolved in crustaceans. This paper reviews the various hemocyanin subtypes and isoforms in shrimp and analyses published genomic data of sixteen hemocyanin family genes from Litopenaeus vannamei to explore the evolution of hemocyanin genes, subunits, and protein structure. Analysis of hemocyanin subtypes distribution and structure in various tissues was also performed and related to multiple and tissue-specific functions, i.e., immunological activity, immune signaling, phenoloxidase activity, modulation of microbiota homeostasis, and energy metabolism. The functional diversity of shrimp hemocyanin due to molecular polymorphism, transcriptional regulation, alternative splicing, degradation into functional peptides, interaction with other proteins or genes, and structural differences will also be highlighted for future research. Inferences would be drawn from other crustaceans to explain how evolution has changed the structure-function of hemocyanin and its implication for evolutionary research into the multifunctionality of hemocyanin and other related proteins in shrimp.",2023,12,30
Vitamin C enhances the sensitivity of osteosarcoma to arsenic trioxide via inhibiting aerobic glycolysis.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is a common malignant tumor disease in the department of orthopedics, which is prone to the age of adolescents and children under 20 years old. Arsenic trioxide (ATO), an ancient poison, has been reported to play a critical role in a variety of tumor treatments, including OS. However, due to certain poisonous side effects such as cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, clinical application of ATO has been greatly limited. Here we report that low doses of ATO (1 μM) observably reduced the half-effective inhibitory concentration (IC50) of vitamin C on OS cells. Compared with the treatment alone, the synthetic application of vitamin C (VitC, 800 μM) and ATO (1 μM) significantly further inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OS cells and promoted cell apoptosis in vitro. Meanwhile, we observed that the combined application of VitC and ATO directly suppresses the aerobic glycolysis of OS cells with the decreased production of pyruvate, lactate, and ATP via inhibiting the expression of the critical glycolytic genes (PGK1, PGM1, and LDHA). Moreover, the combination of VitC (200 mg/kg) and ATO (1 mg/kg) with tail vein injection significantly delayed OS growth and migration of nude mice by inhibiting aerobic glycolysis of OS. Thus, our results demonstrate that VitC effectively increases the sensitivity of OS to low concentrations of ATO via inhibiting aerobic glycolysis to alleviate the toxic side effects of high doses of arsenic trioxide, suggesting that synthetic application of VitC and ATO is a promising approach for the clinical treatment of human OS.",2023,12,30

Fully integrated wearable microneedle biosensing platform for wide-range and real-time continuous glucose monitoring.,"Wearable microneedle sensors for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) have great potential for clinical impact by allowing access to large data sets to provide individualized treatment plans. To date, their development has been challenged by the accurate wide linear range tracking of interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose (Glu) levels. Here, we present a CGM platform consisting of a three-electrode microneedle electrochemical biosensor and a fully integrated radio-chemical analysis system. The long-term performance of the robust CGM on diabetic rats was achieved by electrodepositing Prussian blue (PB), and crosslinking glucose oxidase (GOx) and chitosan to form a 3D network using glutaraldehyde (GA). After redox by GOx, PB rapidly decomposes hydrogen peroxide and mediates charge transfer, while the 3D network and graphite powder provide enrichment and release sites for Glu and catalytic products, enabling a sensing range of 0.25-35 mM. Microneedle CGM has high sensitivity, good stability, and anti-interference ability. In diabetic rats, CGM can accurately monitor Glu levels in the ISF in real-time, which are highly consistent with levels measured by commercial Glu meters. These results indicate the feasibility and application prospects of the PB-based CGM for the clinical management of diabetes. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study addresses the challenge of continuous glucose monitoring system design where the narrow linear range of sensing due to the miniaturization of sensors fails to meet the monitoring needs of clinical diabetic patients. This was achieved by utilizing a three-dimensional network of glutaraldehyde cross-linked glucose oxidase and chitosan. The unique topology of the 3D network provides a large number of sites for glucose enrichment and anchors the enzyme to the sensing medium and the conductive substrate through covalent bonding, successfully blocking the escape of the enzyme and the sensing medium and shortening the electron transfer and transmission path.",2023,12,29
Fe/N co-doped magnetic porous hydrochar for chromium(VI) removal in water: Adsorption performance and mechanism investigation.,"Four kinds of Fe/N co-doped porous hydrochar were prepared by one/two-step N-doping schemes using microwave/traditional pyrolysis methods for removing Cr(VI) from aqueous phase. Heterocyclic-N was introduced through CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-based hydrothermal carbonization process, which could adjust the electronic structure of the hydrochar framework. Furthermore, Fe<sup>0</sup> and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> were embedded into hydrochar via carbothermal reduction reaction using FeCl<sub>3</sub> as the precursor, which improved the reducibility and magnetism of the material. The modified hydrochar exhibited pH-dependency and rapid kinetic equilibrium, and the maximal adsorption amount of magnetic porous hydrochar obtained by microwave-assisted one-step N-doping (MP<sub>1</sub>HC<sub>MW</sub>) reached 274.34 mg/g. Meanwhile, the modified hydrochar had a high tolerance to multiple co-existing ions and the removal efficiency maintained above 73.91 % during five regeneration cycles. Additionally, MP<sub>1</sub>HC<sub>MW</sub> efficiently removed Cr(VI) via pore filling, electrostatic attraction, ion exchange, reduction, complexation, and precipitation. Summarily, Fe/N co-doped porous hydrochar was a feasible adsorbent with outstanding remediation potential for Cr(VI)-contaminated water.",2023,12,30
ViCEKb: Vitiligo-linked Chemical Exposome Knowledgebase.,"Vitiligo is a complex disease wherein the environmental factors, in conjunction with the underlying genetic predispositions, trigger the autoimmune destruction of melanocytes, ultimately leading to depigmented patches on the skin. While genetic factors have been extensively studied, the knowledge on environmental triggers remains sparse and less understood. To address this knowledge gap, we present the first comprehensive knowledgebase of vitiligo-triggering chemicals namely, Vitiligo-linked Chemical Exposome Knowledgebase (ViCEKb). ViCEKb involves an extensive and systematic manual effort in curation of published literature and subsequent compilation of 113 unique chemical triggers of vitiligo. ViCEKb standardizes various chemical information, and categorizes the chemicals based on their evidences and sources of exposure. Importantly, ViCEKb contains a wide range of metrics necessary for different toxicological evaluations. Notably, we observed that ViCEKb chemicals are present in a variety of consumer products. For instance, Propyl gallate is present as a fragrance substance in various household products, and Flutamide is used in medication to treat prostate cancer. These two chemicals have the highest level of evidence in ViCEKb, but are not regulated for their skin sensitizing effects. Furthermore, an extensive cheminformatics-based investigation revealed that ViCEKb chemical space is structurally diverse and comprises unique chemical scaffolds in comparison with skin specific regulatory lists. For example, Neomycin and 2,3,5-Triglycidyl-4-aminophenol have unique chemical scaffolds and the highest level of evidence in ViCEKb, but are not regulated for their skin sensitizing effects. Finally, a transcriptomics-based analysis of ViCEKb chemical perturbations in skin cell samples highlighted the commonality in their linked biological processes. Overall, we present the first comprehensive effort in compilation and exploration of various chemical triggers of vitiligo. We believe such a resource will enable in deciphering the complex etiology of vitiligo and aid in the characterization of human chemical exposome. ViCEKb is freely available for academic research at: https://cb.imsc.res.in/vicekb.",2023,12,29
Safe utilization evaluation of two typical traditional Chinese medicinal materials in Cd-contaminated soil based on the analysis of Cd transfer and AHP model.,"Due to the increasing scarcity of wild resources, most traditional Chinese medicinal materials (TCMMs) in the market are produced via artificial cultivation. The widespread pollution of cadmium (Cd) in soil limits the safe cultivation and use of TCMMs. This study investigated Cd accumulation, distribution, and the medicinal component content under simulated field conditions to clarify the differences in the Cd absorption, transfer and detoxification mechanisms of Polygonatum cyrtonema Hua and Bletilla striata, and provide the preliminary safe utilization conditions of TCMMs based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The results showed that the Cd content of P. cyrtonema Hua was lower than the safety threshold under a high soil Cd concentration of 0.91 mg/kg (Cd-L), while B. striata was safe only at a low Cd concentration of 0.25 mg/kg (CK). Cd at 0.91 mg/kg induced hormesis affecting the net increase in biomass and medicinal component content for both TCMMs, while P. cyrtonema Hua showed better potential for safe utilization. Additionally, P. cyrtonema Hua had stronger resistance to Cd stress, exhibiting superior characteristics for synergistic absorption of Cd with mineral elements, transfer to nonmedical part and safer fixation forms in subcellular components. In contrast, B. striata showed insufficient Cd tolerance, and Cd was easily accumulated in organelles to inhibit plant growth. Our findings may attract more attention to the safe cultivation of TCMMs and provide insight into guidance for the safe utilization of slightly Cd-contaminated soil.",2023,12,30
"A prospective longitudinal study on the elimination trend of rural cutaneous leishmaniasis in southeastern Iran: Climate change, population displacement, and agricultural transition from 1991 to 2021.","Leishmaniasis is a complex disease. Any change in weather conditions affects the humans' social and agricultural expansion and, consequently, the parasite's life cycle in terms of ecology, biodiversity, social stigma, and exclusion. This population-based prospective longitudinal investigation was conducted between 1991 and 2021 in a well-defined CL (cutaneous leishmaniasis) focus in Bam County, southeastern Iran. A robust health clinic and health surveillance system were responsible for the ongoing systematic documentation, detection, identification, and management of CL cases. The exponential smoothing method via the state space model was used in the univariate time series. The TTR, smooth, and forecast packages were used in R software. Landsat satellite images from 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2021 were employed in the physical development. During this period, the temperature increased while the rainfall and humidity decreased. The findings showed a downward trend in the standardized drought index. Also, the results showed that climate warming and ecological changes profoundly affected the area's agricultural patterns and topographical features. Furthermore, the last three decades witnessed an elimination trend for zoonotic CL (ZCL) and the predominance of anthroponotic CL (ACL). The present findings showed that the critical factors in the predominance of ACL and elimination of ZCL were rising temperature, drought, migration, unplanned urbanization, earthquake, and agrarian reform. The wall-enclosed palm tree gardens excluded the primary ZCL reservoir host. They controlled the disease while providing suitable conditions for the emergence/re-emergence of ACL in the newly established settlements and the unplanned ecozone. Therefore, robust health infrastructures, sustained financial support, and evidence-based research studies are crucial to facilitating the necessary surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation to control and eliminate the disease.",2023,12,29
Thermocline stratification favors phytoplankton spatial overlap and species diversity in a subtropical deep reservoir.,"Spatial segregation of species along opposing resource gradients is a major research topic in ecology as it enables the coexistence and maintenance of high diversity. Thermocline stratification causes heterogeneous resource distribution, however, the effect of thermocline stratification on phytoplankton dynamic in-depth profiles is still unclear. To understand the underlying mechanism behind the effects of thermocline stratification on phytoplankton species diversity in stratified lakes, the monthly changes in thermocline parameters, deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) parameters, spatial overlap (SO) among major phytoplankton taxonomic groups, and phytoplankton species diversity were evaluated in Lake Qiandaohu in the Zhejiang Province of China from April 2017 to December 2018. Thermocline depth (TD) was significantly negatively related to thermocline strength (TS). The monthly air temperature was the main driver behind the thermocline and the seasonal thermal-stratification cycle was divided into two stratification stages. Significant linear relationships were observed between the DCM parameters (depth, concentration, and thickness) and TD during the strong stratification period. TD was significantly positively related to phytoplankton species diversity and the SO between Cryptophyta and Chlorophyta as well as between Cryptophyta and Bacillariophyta during weak stratification periods. Significant positive correlations were observed between SO and Shannon diversity during both periods. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that air temperature significantly decreased TD and increased species diversity by increasing SO during the strong stratification period. Strong stratification under warming favored the formation of shallower and thinner DCMs, leading to phytoplankton coexistence and maintenance of high species diversity through a preclusion of dominance. This study characterized the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton dynamic in-depth profiles in response to strong stratification from warming.",2023,12,30
Integrated approach for the isotope trophic position of black-tailed gull (Larus crassirostris) eggs over a decade: Combining stable isotopes of amino acids and fatty acids composition.,"Recently, compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) using the amino acid nitrogen stable isotope ratio (δ<sup>15</sup>N<sub>AAs</sub>) has been widely used for accurate estimation of trophic position (TP). In addition, a quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) offers insights into diet sources. In this study, we used these techniques to estimate the TP for seabirds that rely on diverse food sources across multiple ecosystems. This allows for the proper combination of factors used in TP calculation which are different for each ecosystem. The approach involved the application of a multi-mixing trophic discrimination factor (TDF) and mixing β which is a Δδ<sup>15</sup>N between trophic and source amino acid of primary producer. Since the black-tailed gulls (BTGs) are income-breeding seabirds, which rely on energy sources obtained around their breeding sites, they and their eggs could be useful bioindicators for environmental monitoring. However, the ecological properties of BTGs such as habitats, diets, and TP are not well known due to their large migration range for wintering or breeding and their feeding habits on both aquatic and terrestrial prey. In this study, the eggs were used for estimating TP and for predicting TP of mother birds to overcome difficulties such as capturing birds and collecting non-invasive tissue samples. Eggs, sampled over a decade from three Korean islands, showed spatial differences in diet origin. Considering both the food chain and physiology of BTG, the TP of eggs was estimated to be 3.3-4.0. Notably, the TP was significantly higher at site H (3.8 ± 0.1) than at site B (3.5 ± 0.2), which indicated a higher contribution of marine diet as confirmed by QFASA. Using a reproductive shift of δ<sup>15</sup>N<sub>AAs</sub>, the TP of the mother birds was predicted to be 3.6-4.3, positioning them as the top predator in the food web. The advanced integration of multiple approaches provides valuable insights into bird ecology.",2023,12,30
Reevaluating the accuracy and specificity of EDTA-based polyphosphate quantification method.,"Feng et al. (2020) developed a simple, nondestructive, and cost-effective method to quantify polyphosphate (poly-P) in poly-P-accumulating organism (PAO)-enriched sludge samples through 30-h anaerobic exposure to 1 % (w/v) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). This study optimized the N/P ratio (∼2) of the PAO culture medium in order to provide excess P for poly-P formation in PAO cells. Subsequently, the fluorescence microscopic observation of stained cells confirmed that Corynebacterium glutamicum was a PAO species capable of heterotrophic nitrification. Finally, this study reevaluated the accuracy and specificity of the EDTA-based quantification method, using two confirmed PAO biomass, three confirmed non-PAO biomass, and two sludge samples. The 1 % (w/v) EDTA treatment appears destructive to non-PAO cells, causes the release of other P forms, and is not effective for all PAO species. Under the conditions, the actual P release amount should be calculated by subtracting approximately 8 mg P g<sup>-1</sup> total suspended solids from the determination. The amounts of P released from sludge samples was determined not only by the PAO fractions described by Feng et al. but also by PAO community structure and sludge P content.",2023,12,30
Cardiovascular comorbidities are associated with dermatomyositis: A cross-sectional study in the All of Us Research Program.,"This study does not address how DM treatments (e.g. systemic steroids, methotrexate) might influence CVD development in DM and further investigation is warranted. Additional limitations include using EHRs which may have diagnostic inaccuracies/omissions, lack of data on clinical features/severity/subtype, and use of a non-representative U.S. cohort. Our findings are important both for prognosis and clinical care, suggesting DM patients should be screened for CVD risk factors to potentially reduce the increased risk of cardiovascular events and CVD-related mortality in DM.",2023,12,29

Evaluation of Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate toxicity on the third instar larvae of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ) Bg<sup>9</sup>.,"Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, generally known as DEHP is a synthetic compound mainly used as a plasticizer to make polyvinyl chloride products flexible and soft. The present work aimed to study the toxicity of Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate on the third instar larvae of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster(hsp70-lacZ) Bg<sup>9</sup>. The hsp70 gene is associated with the β-galactosidase in our present transgenic strain therefore, the more activity of β-galactosidase will indirectly correspond to hsp70 expression. The third instar larvae were allowed to feed on the diet for 24 h having 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02 M of Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate at the final concentration. After the exposure of 24hrs, the larvae were subjected to ONPG assay, X-gal staining, trypan blue exclusion test, oxidative stress markers assays, and comet assay. A dose-dependent increase in hsp70 expression, tissue damage, Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, lipid peroxidation, monoamine oxidase, caspase-9 & 3, protein carbonyl content (PCC), DNA damage and decrease in the glutathione (GSH) content, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydrogenase (ẟ-ALD-D) and acetylcholinesterase activity were observed in the larvae exposed to 0.005, 0.01, 0.02 M of Bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. The dose of 0.001 M of Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate did not showed any toxic effects and hence can be considered as No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. The study supports the use of Drosophila for the evaluation of possible toxic effects associated with synthetic compounds.",2023,12,29
Exposure to microcrystallized cellulose affects the health of tadpoles and sheds light on the threat these materials pose to amphibians.,"The increasing use of cellulose-based materials (CBMs) has provided beneficial applications in different sectors. However, its release into environments may represent an ecological risk, therefore demanding that ecotoxicological studies be conducted to understand the risks (current and future) of CBM pollution. Thus, we evaluated the possible effects of microcrystalline cellulose (CMs) in Physalaemus cuvieri tadpoles. After seven days of exposure to CMs (at 58.29 and 100 mg/L), the animals were subjected to behavioral evaluation, and different biomarkers (biometric and biochemical) were evaluated. Although our data do not point to a neurotoxic effect of CMs (inferred by the absence of behavioral changes and changes in AChE and BChE activity), animals exposed to CMs showed differences in body condition. Furthermore, we noticed an increase in the frequency of erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities and DNA damage, which were correlated with the ingestion of CMs. We noticed that the antioxidant activity of tadpoles exposed to CMs (inferred by SOD, CAT, and DPPH radical scavenging activity) was insufficient to control the increase in ROS and MDA production. Furthermore, exposure to CMs induced a predominant Th2-specific immune response, marked by suppressed IFN-γ and increased IL-10 levels, with a consequent reduction in NO levels. Principal component analysis and IBRv-2 indicate, in general, a primarily more toxic response to animals exposed to the highest CM concentration. Therefore, our study evidence that CMs affect the health of P. cuvieri tadpoles and sheds light on the threat these materials pose to amphibians.",2023,12,29
Long-term investigation of microplastic abundance in Squalius species in Turkish inland waters.,"Examining the enduring alterations in microplastic (MP) concentrations within fish in inland waters is of utmost importance in understanding the historical trajectory of plastic waste and formulating consequential predictions regarding upcoming pollution levels. This study includes the collection of fish samples from 22 different river basins in Türkiye and all Squalius species distributed in Türkiye, covering the years 2004-2018, and examined the presence of MP in museum specimens' gastrointestinal tracts (GITs). 331 specimens were examined, and microplastic was observed in 20.8% (69). A mean value of 0.27 ± 0.19 MP per individual was observed, resulting in a cumulative score of 91 MP. Most observed MPs were composed of fiber, representing 79.1% of the total. The polymer types identified were mostly polyethylene (PE) at 38.5% and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at 29.7%. The black color was prominent among MPs, and MP length ranged between 101 and 4963 μm. The analysis revealed no statistically significant difference in the mean MP values across different years and basins. There is no substantial correlation between the abundance of MP and the sizes of fish, population density, or quantities of plastic production. The data indicate that MP has persistently acted as a contaminant in freshwater ecosystems over an extended period. It is projected that the laundering of synthetic textiles serves as the primary contributor to MP contamination in freshwater bodies. Our results offer significant baseline data on the pervasive issue of MP pollution in the freshwater environment. These findings enable us to gain profound insights into the current state of MP contamination in fish residing in lotic systems while empowering us to make accurate predictions about its future trajectory.",2023,12,29
Effect of plastic mulch residue on plant growth performance and soil properties.,"Plastic mulch is widely utilized for weed control, temperature regulation, soil erosion prevention, disease management, and soil structure improvement, ultimately enhancing crop quality and yield. However, a significant issue with conventional plastic mulches is their low recycling rates, which can cause plastic residue to build up, thereby damaging soil quality and reducing crop yield. The emergence of biodegradable films offers a promising solution to mitigate this issue and reduce soil pollution. However, its potential effects on soil properties and plant performance remain unclear. In this study, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and poly (butylene succinate-co-butylene adipate) (PBSA) were used to observe the effect of plastic mulch residues on soil properties and plant growth performance via potting experiment. Additionally, the interaction effects of compost and biochar as soil amendments with plastic mulch residues were also evaluated. The result of this study revealed that the type of plastic significantly affected the total nitrogen and magnesium uptake; however, the morphological traits of the tested plant (Japanese mustard spinach) were not significantly affected. The addition of compost and biochar led to a significant increase in both shoot and total dry weight of the plant, indicating a positive effect on its growth. The results of the two-way ANOVA indicated a significant influence of plastic type on dissolved phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>) levels and soil dehydrogenase activity (DHA). The interaction effect (plastic type with soil amendment) was statistically significant only for soil DHA. Neither plastic mulch residues nor soil amendments significantly affected other soil chemical properties. However, long-term experiments to systematically investigate the long-term effects of plastic residues are necessary.",2023,12,29

Effects of Exercise Training on ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL4/8 and their Associations with Cardiometabolic Traits.,"Angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL) complexes 3/8 and 4/8 are established inhibitors of LPL and novel therapeutic targets for dyslipidemia. However, the effects of regular exercise on ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL4/8 are unknown. We characterized ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL4/8 and their relationship with in vivo measurements of lipase activities and cardiometabolic traits before and after a 5 month endurance exercise training intervention in 642 adults from the HERITAGE Family Study. At baseline, higher levels of both ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL4/8 were associated with a worse lipid, lipoprotein, and cardiometabolic profile, with only ANGPTL3/8 associated with post-heparin LPL and HL activities. ANGPTL3/8 significantly decreased with exercise training, which corresponded with increases in LPL activity and decreases in HL activity, plasma triglycerides, apoB, visceral fat, and fasting insulin (all p<5.1x10<sup>-4</sup>). Exercise-induced changes in ANGPTL4/8 were directly correlated to concomitant changes in total cholesterol, LDL-C, apoB, and HDL-triglycerides and inversely related to change in insulin sensitivity index (all p<7.0x10<sup>-4</sup>). In conclusion, exercise-induced decreases in ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL4/8 were related to concomitant improvements in lipase activity, lipid profile, and cardiometabolic risk factors. These findings reveal the ANGPTL3-4-8 model as a potential molecular mechanism contributing to adaptations in lipid metabolism in response to exercise training.",2023,12,29
Statin treatment remodels the HDL subclass lipidome and proteome in hypertriglyceridemia.,"HDL particles vary in lipidome and proteome, which dictate their individual physicochemical properties, metabolism, and biological activities. HDL dysmetabolism in non-diabetic hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) involves subnormal HDL-cholesterol and apoAI levels. Metabolic anomalies may impact the qualitative features of both the HDL lipidome and proteome. Whether particle content of bioactive lipids and proteins may differentiate HDL subclasses (HDL2b, 2a, 3a, 3b and 3c) in HTG is unknown. Moreover, little is known of the effect of statin treatment on the proteolipidome of hypertriglyceridemic HDL and its subclasses. Non-diabetic, obese, HTG males (n=12) received pitavastatin calcium (4mg/day) for 180 days in a single-phase, unblinded study. ApoB-containing lipoproteins were normalized post-statin. Individual proteolipidomes of density-defined HDL subclasses were characterized pre- and post-statin. At baseline, dense HDL3c was distinguished by marked protein diversity and peak abundance of surface lysophospholipids, amphipathic DAG and dhCer, and core CE and TAG, (normalized to mol PC), whereas light HDL2b showed peak abundance of COH, SM, glycosphingolipids (MHC, DHC, THC and anionic GM3), thereby arguing for differential lipid transport and metabolism between subclasses. Post-statin, bioactive lysophospholipid (LPC, LPC(O), LPE and LPI) cargo was preferentially depleted in HDL3c. By contrast, baseline lipidomic profiles of ceramide, dhCer and related glycosphingolipids and GM3/PC were maintained across particle subclasses. All subclasses were depleted in TAG and DAG/PC. The abundance of apolipoproteins CI, CII, CIV and M diminished in the HDL proteome. Statin treatment principally impacts metabolic remodeling of the abnormal lipidome of HDL particle subclasses in non-diabetic HTG, with lesser effects on the proteome.",2023,12,29
Biomarkers of early SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the onset of respiratory symptoms.,Limited data currently exist regarding the pathological changes occurring during the incubation phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"Pseudomonas aeruginosa antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, resistance mechanisms and international clonal lineages: update from ESGARS-ESCMID/ISARPAE Group.","Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen considered one of the paradigms of antimicrobial resistance, is among the main causes of hospital-acquired and chronic infections associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This growing threat results from the extraordinary capacity of P. aeruginosa to develop antimicrobial resistance through chromosomal mutations, the increasing prevalence of transferable resistance determinants (such as the carbapenemases and the extended spectrum β-lactamases), and the global expansion of epidemic lineages. The general objective of this initiative is to provide a comprehensive update of P. aeruginosa resistance mechanisms, especially for the extensively drug-resistant (XDR)/difficult to treat resistance (DTR) international high-risk epidemic lineages, and how the recently approved β-lactams and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations may affect resistance mechanisms and the definition of susceptibility profiles.",2023,12,29

Enhanced poly-γ-glutamic acid synthesis in Corynebacterium glutamicum by reconstituting PgsBCA complex and fermentation optimization.,"Previously, a novel Corynebacterium glutamicum strain for the de novo biosynthesis of tailored poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) has been constructed by our group. The strain was based on the γ-PGA synthetase complex, PgsBCA, which is the only polyprotein complex responsible for γ-PGA synthesis in Bacillus spp. In the present study, PgsBCA was reconstituted and overexpressed in C. glutamicum to further enhance γ-PGA synthesis. First, we confirmed that all the components (PgsB, PgsC, and PgsA) of γ-PGA synthetase derived from B. licheniformis are necessary for γ-PGA synthesis, and γ-PGA was detected only when PgsB, PgsC, and PgsA were expressed in combination in C. glutamicum. Next, the expression level of each pgsB, pgsC, and pgsA was tuned in order to explore the effect of expression of each of the γ-PGA synthetase subunits on γ-PGA production. Results showed that increasing the transcription levels of pgsB or pgsC and maintaining a medium-level transcription level of pgsA led to 35.44% and 76.53% increase in γ-PGA yield (γ-PGA yield-to-biomass), respectively. Notably, the expression level of pgsC had the greatest influence (accounting for 68.24%) on γ-PGA synthesis, followed by pgsB. Next, genes encoding for PgsC from four different sources (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus methylotrophicus, and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) were tested in order to identify the influence of PgsC-encoding orthologues on γ-PGA production, but results showed that in all cases the synthesis of γ-PGA was significantly inhibited. Similarly, we also explored the influence of gene orthologues encoding for PgsB on γ-PGA production, and found that the titer increased to 17.14 ± 0.62 g/L from 8.24 ± 0.10 g/L when PgsB derived from B. methylotrophicus replaced PgsB alone in PgsBCA from B. licheniformis. The resulting strain was chosen for further optimization, and we achieved a γ-PGA titer of 38.26 g/L in a 5 L fermentor by optimizing dissolved oxygen level. Subsequently, by supplementing glucose, γ-PGA titer increased to 50.2 g/L at 48 h. To the best of our knowledge, this study achieved the highest titer for de novo production of γ-PGA from glucose, without addition of L-glutamic acid, resulting in a novel strategy for enhancing γ-PGA production.",2023,12,29
Subretinal hyperreflective material (SHRM) in retinal and chorioretinal disorders: A comprehensive review.,"Subretinal hyperreflective material (SHRM) is a common and remarkable optical coherence tomography (OCT) biomarker whose importance is emerging in several retinal and chorioretinal diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, central serous chorioretinopathy, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, pathologic myopia, posterior uveitis, vitelliform lesions and macular dystrophies, and more rare disorders. Multimodal imaging, also thanks to the introduction of OCT angiography, allowed a deeper characterisation of SHRM components and its morphological changes after treatment, suggesting its usefulness in clinical practice. In our review, we discuss and summarize the nature, multimodal imaging characteristics, and prognostic and predictive significance of SHRM in the different retinal and choroidal disorders in which it has been described.",2023,12,29

A review of recent FDA-approved biologic-device combination products.,"With the remarkably strong growth of the biopharmaceutical market, an increasing demand for self-administration and rising competitions attract substantial interest to the biologic-device combination products. The ease-of-use of biologic-device combination products can minimize dosing error, improve patient compliance and add value to the life-cycle management of biological products. As listed in the purple book issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a total of 98 brand biologic-device combination products have been approved with Biologic License Application from January 2000 to August 2023, where this review mainly focused on 63 products containing neither insulin nor vaccine. Prefilled syringes (PFS) and autoinjectors are the most widely adopted devices, whereas innovative modifications like needle safety guard and dual-chamber design and novel devices like on-body injector also emerged as promising presentations. All 16 insulin products employ pen injectors, while all 19 vaccine products are delivered by a PFS. This review provides a systematic summary of FDA-approved biologic-device combination products regarding their device configurations, routes of administration, formulations, instructions for use, etc. In addition, challenges and opportunities associated with biologic-device compatibility, regulatory complexity, and smart connected devices are also discussed. It is believed that evolving technologies will definitely move the boundaries of biologic-device combination product development even further.",2023,12,29
The Use of Carboxyfluorescein Reveals the Transport Function of MCT6/SLC16A5 Associated with CD147 as a Chloride-Sensitive Organic Anion Transporter in Mammalian Cells.,"Oral drug absorption involves drug permeation across the apical and basolateral membranes of enterocytes. Although transporters mediating the influx of anionic drugs in the apical membranes have been identified, transporters responsible for efflux in the basolateral membranes remain unclear. Monocarboxylate transporter 6 (MCT6/SLC16A5) has been reported to localize to the apical and basolateral membranes of human enterocytes and to transport organic anions such as bumetanide and nateglinide in the Xenopus oocyte expression system; however, its transport functions have not been elucidated in detail. In this study, we characterized the function of MCT6 expressed in HEK293T cells and explored fluorescent probes to more easily evaluate MCT6 function. The results illustrated that MCT6 interacts with CD147 to localize at the plasma membrane. When the uptake of various fluorescein derivatives was examined in NaCl-free uptake buffer (pH 5.5), the uptake of 5-carboxyfluorescein (5-CF) was significantly greater in MCT6 and CD147-expressing cells. MCT6-mediated 5-CF uptake was saturable with a K<sub>m</sub> of 1.07 mM and inhibited by several substrates/inhibitors of organic anion transporters and extracellular Cl ion with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 53.7 mM.

Neuronal Hyperactivity in the Hippocampus During the Early Stage of Streptozotocin-induced Type 1 Diabetes in Mice.,"Introduction Cognitive dysfunction due to reduced neuronal transmission in the brain is a major emerging complication in diabetes. However, recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated non-linear changes including hyperactivity in the hippocampus during the early stage of diabetes. This study aimed to determine the changes in neuronal activity at a single-cell level in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in the early stage of streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes in mice. Methods Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from acute brain slices were performed in mice over 4 consecutive weeks following the induction of hyperglycaemia using streptozotocin. In addition, microdialysate was collected from CA1 area while the mice were in an arousal state. The concentrations of glutamate and GABA in the microdialysate was then measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Results CA1 Neurons in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice exhibited higher membrane potentials (p = 0.0052), higher frequency of action potentials (p = 0.0052), and higher frequency of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (p = 0.037) compared with controls during the second week after hyperglycaemia was established. No changes in electrophysiological parameters were observed during the first, the third and the fourth week. Moreover, the diabetic mice had higher extracellular glutamate concentration in CA1 area compared with controls (p = 0.021) during the second week after the initiation of diabetes. No change in the extracellular GABA concentration was observed. Conclusion Our study demonstrated a temporary state of neuronal hyperactivity at the single-cell level in the hippocampal CA1 region during the early stage of diabetes. This neuronal hyperactivity might be related to altered glutamate metabolism and provide clues for future brain-target intervention.",2023,12,30
Impact of first wave of COVID-19 pandemic on mortality at emergency department in elderly patients with covid and non-covid diagnoses.,Mortality in emergency departments (ED) is not well known.

Generalization of auditory expertise in audio engineers and instrumental musicians.,"From auditory perception to general cognition, the ability to play a musical instrument has been associated with skills both related and unrelated to music. However, it is unclear if these effects are bound to the specific characteristics of musical instrument training, as little attention has been paid to other populations such as audio engineers and designers whose auditory expertise may match or surpass that of musicians in specific auditory tasks or more naturalistic acoustic scenarios. We explored this possibility by comparing students of audio engineering (n = 20) to matched conservatory-trained instrumentalists (n = 24) and to naive controls (n = 20) on measures of auditory discrimination, auditory scene analysis, and speech in noise perception. We found that audio engineers and performing musicians had generally lower psychophysical thresholds than controls, with pitch perception showing the largest effect size. Compared to controls, audio engineers could better memorise and recall auditory scenes composed of non-musical sounds, whereas instrumental musicians performed best in a sustained selective attention task with two competing streams of tones. Finally, in a diotic speech-in-babble task, musicians showed lower signal-to-noise-ratio thresholds than both controls and engineers; however, a follow-up online study did not replicate this musician advantage. We also observed differences in personality that might account for group-based self-selection biases. Overall, we showed that investigating a wider range of forms of auditory expertise can help us corroborate (or challenge) the specificity of the advantages previously associated with musical instrument training.",2023,12,30
"Synergistic effect of surfactant and 1,10-decanedithiol as corrosion inhibitor for zinc anode in alkaline electrolyte of zinc-air batteries.","The self-discharge by corrosion of zinc-air batteries (ZABs) will result in the reduced coulombic efficiency and lower energy efficiency. The additives in electrolyte should not only inhibit the occurrence of self-corrosion during battery dormancy, but also achieve a stable cycle of adsorption-desorption during battery operation, improving the durability of discharge cycles. But the former requires strong binding between additives and zinc to form a dense protective film, while the latter requires easy desorption of additives and zinc without affecting discharge power, which is contradictory to balance. In this study, a dynamic combination of additives and zinc, as well as a design of multi-channel strategy for the corresponding protective layer, have been proposed to solve the issues of self-corrosion and discharge cycle stability. Specifically, the surfactant (octylphenol polyoxyethylene ether phosphate (OP-10P)) and 1,10-decanedithiol (DD) have been selected as the combined anti-corrosion additives in ZABs with concentrated alkaline solution. The synergistic inhibition mechanism and the stabilization mechanism in zinc-air full cells have been studied systematically. The results indicated that the combined inhibitors inhibited the self-corrosion of Zn efficiently in the dormancy, and the inhibition efficiency reached 99.9 % at the optimized proportion. OP-10P achieve the preferential adsorption on the zinc surface, and then the chelates of DD with Zn<sup>2+</sup> deposit on the outer layer to form the protective film with fine hydrophobic performance. The stability of ZABs in discharge and charging cycles has been improved owing to the multilayer adsorption film on zinc surface, which retains ion transport channels with the homogeneously pores to weaken the dendrites and side reactions during galvanostatic cycles. A probable model on zinc surface was established to discuss the actual working mechanism.",2023,12,27
Prognostic value of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in multiple sclerosis: The key role of kappa free light chains and a multivariate predictor for disease progression.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with varying progression rates among individuals. The ability to predict disease progression is crucial for treatment decisions with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). A few cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have been investigated in relation to disease progression, but few have been effectively translated into clinical practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of known CSF markers, to compare their sensitivity and specificity, and to develop a prognostic model using a combination of markers to predict disease progression.",2023,12,22
Metal doped silica nanohybrids with extensive bacterial coverage for antibacterial applications exhibit synergistic activity.,"Nanotechnology has triumphantly overcome several barriers that have formed in modern life. Bacterial infections are a critical public health issue. They emphasized the failure of conventional treatments, high mortality and morbidity rates, antibiotic resistance, and other factors leading to the development of novel and affordable antibacterial medications. In this study, three types of metals (Ag, Cu, and Co) were doped separately into a silanol network in silica nanoparticles. The synthesized monometallic nanohybrids were combined in equal proportions to formulate bi and trimetallic nanohybrids. They were characterized structurally and morphologically. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy studies were used to investigate the formation of the bonds and the pertinent peak positions. X-ray diffractograms (XRD) validated the crystalline structures of the metal nanohybrids. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study (XPS) confirmed the successful addition of metals to the silanol network. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were used to characterize the morphology of nanohybrids and demonstrate their dimensions are on the nanoscale. The fraction of each metal doped in the silanol network was determined using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). To assess activity and confirm antibacterial synergy, the antibacterial activity of all synthesized nanohybrids was examined. The minimum inhibitory concentration-MIC (Ranged from 12.25 to 1560.00 μg/mL), minimum bactericidal concentration-MBC (Ranged from 197.00 to 3125.00 μg/mL), IC<sub>50</sub> values (Ranged from 30.56 to 1683.00 μg/mL-) and fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) were determined and compared. Well diffusion assay was conducted against both ATCC cultures and clinical samples of gram-positive bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619), MRSA (ATCC 33591) and gram-negative bacteria; Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC BAA 1706) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). The highest synergistic radical scavenging performance of trimetallic nanohybrid (90.67 ± 0.095 %) was established by the DPPH (2,2 diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil) experiment. Finally, when compared to monometallic nanohybrids, it was demonstrated that the synthesized multimetallic nanohybrids have a substantial potential as an emerging and cost-effective antibacterial agent.",2023,12,27
Scolicidal and apoptotic effects of phyto- and chemically synthesized silver/boehmite nanocomposites on Echinococcus granulosus protoscoleces.,"Cystic hydatid disease (CHD) is a zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus (E. granulosus). This study aimed to synthesize silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), silver boehmite nanocomposite (Ag/Bhm NC), and silver boehmite nanocomposite modified with chitosan (Ag/Bhm/Chit NC) using Rosmarinus officinalis (R. officinalis) extract and chemical method, and to evaluate their scolicidal and apoptotic effects on protoscoleces (PSCs) in vitro. The nanomaterials (NMs) were characterized by XRD, FTIR, FESEM, EDS, DLS, PDI, and zeta potential (ZP). The NMs were tested against PSCs at different concentrations (0.2-1.6 mg/mL) and exposure times (10-60 min). The size of Ag NPs, phytosynthesized Ag/Bhm NC, Ag/Bhm/Chit NC, and chemically synthesized Ag/Bhm NC were 25.55, 43, 72.3, and 60.8 nm, respectively. Ag NPs and phytosynthesized Ag/Bhm NC showed the highest scolicidal effect, with 65.34 % and 51.60 % mortality rate at 1.6 mg/mL and 60 min, respectively. Caspase-3 mRNA expression was higher in PSCs treated with Ag NPs and Ag/Bhm NC than in control groups (P < 0.05). Phytosynthesized Ag/Bhm NC had stronger scolicidal and apoptotic effect than chemically synthesized Ag/Bhm NC. Ag/Bhm/Chit NC had a weaker scolicidal effect but higher gene expression than Ag/Bhm NC. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of phytosynthesized Ag NPs and Ag/Bhm NC as effective scolicidal and apoptotic agents against PSCs of hydatid cysts, which may be useful for the treatment of this disease.",2023,12,04
[Reference levels of thyroid hormones in pregnant woman from Guadalajara].,Thyroid dysfunction during gestation impacts on maternal-fetal health and may influence the neurocognitive development of the child.

A biomimetic cuproptosis amplifier for targeted NIR-II fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging-guided synergistic NIR-II photothermal immunotherapy.,"The therapeutic efficacy of cuproptosis combined with phototheranostics is still hindered by easy copper efflux, nonspecific accumulation and limited light penetration depth. Here, a high-performance NIR-II semiconductor polymer was first synthesized through dual-donor engineering. Then a biomimetic cuproptosis amplifier (PCD@CM) was prepared by Cu(II)-mediated coordinative self-assembly of NIR-II ultrasmall polymer dots and the chemotherapeutic drug DOX, followed by camouflaging of tumor cell membranes. After homologous targeting delivery to tumor cells, overexpressed GSH in the tumor microenvironment (TME) triggers the disassembly of the amplifier and the release of therapeutic components through the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), which enable NIR-II fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging-guided NIR-II photothermal therapy (PTT) and chemotherapy. The released Cu(I) induces the aggregation of lipoylated mitochondrial proteins accompanied by the loss of iron-sulfur proteins, leading to severe proteotoxic stress and eventually cuproptosis. NIR-II PTT and GSH depletion render tumor cells more sensitive to cuproptosis. The amplified cuproptosis sensitization provokes significant immune surveillance, triggering the immunogenic cell death (ICD) to promote cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration together with aPD-L1-mediated immune checkpoint blockade. This work proposes a new strategy to develop cuproptosis sensitization systems enhanced by NIR-II phototheranostics with homologous targeting and anti-tumor immune response capabilities.",2023,12,27
Genetically light-enhanced immunotherapy mediated by a fluorinated reduction-sensitive delivery system.,"The lack of safe and efficient therapeutic agent delivery platforms restricts combined therapy's effect, and combined cancer therapy's multi-component delivery effect needs improvement. The novel gene delivery system SS-HPT-F/pMIP-3β-KR was proposed to construct fluorine-containing degradable cationic polymers SS-HPT-F by a mild and simple amino-epoxy ring-opening reaction. By modifying the fluorinated alkyl chain, the delivery efficiency of the plasmid was greatly improved, and the cytoplasmic transport of biomolecules was completed. At the same time, a combination plasmid (MIP-3β-KillerRed) was innovatively designed for the independent expression of immune and photodynamic proteins. Which was efficiently transported to the tumor site by SS-HPT-F. The MIP-3β is expressed as an immune chemokine realize the immune mobilization behavior. The photosensitive protein KillerRed expressed in the tumor killed cancer cells under irradiation and released the exocrine immune factor MIP-3β. The immunogenic cell death (ICD) produced by photodynamic therapy (PDT) also induced the immune response of the organism. The synergistic effect of PDT and MIP-3β mobilized the immune properties of the organism, providing light-enhanced immune combination therapy against malignant tumors. Therefore, in subcutaneous tumor-bearing and metastatic animal models, the carrier tumor growth and mobilize organism produce an immune response without systemic toxicity. This work reports the first efficient gene delivery system that achieves light-enhanced immunotherapy.",2023,12,21
Identification of 4-amino-2-Pyridones as new potent PCSK9 inhibitors: From phenotypic hit discovery to in vivo tolerability.,"Among the strategies to overcome the underperformance of statins in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the development of drugs targeting the Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin-like Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is considered one of the most promising. However, only anti-PCSK9 biological drugs have been approved to date, and orally available small-molecules for the treatment of hypercholesterolemic conditions are still missing on the market. In the present work, we describe the application of a phenotypic approach to the identification and optimization of 4-amino-2-pyridone derivatives as a new chemotype with anti-PCSK9 activity. Starting from an in-house collection of compounds, functional assays on HepG2 cells followed by a chemistry-driven hit optimization campaign, led to the potent anti-PCSK9 candidate 5c. This compound, at 5 μM, totally blocked PCSK9 secretion from HepG2 cells, significantly increased LDL receptor (LDLR) expression, and acted cooperatively with simvastatin by reducing its induction of PCSK9 expression. Finally, compound 5c also proved to be well tolerated in C57BL/6J mice at the tested concentration (40 mg/kg) with no sign of toxicity or behavior modifications.",2023,12,20
Children's bullying victimization and maternal suicidal ideation among multicultural families in South Korea: Heterogeneity by family socioeconomic status.,"Children from multicultural families in Korea are vulnerable to bullying victimization.

Toward the conceptualization and measurement of transphobia-driven intimate partner violence.,"Transgender and gender expansive (trans) people face high rates of violence, including unique forms of abuse from intimate partners that specifically leverage transphobia. Past qualitative studies have explored trans-specific intimate partner violence (IPV) and transgender IPV; we propose a new term, transphobia-driven IPV, investigated in this paper. The goals of this study were two-fold: (1) to qualitatively identify the subdomains and boundaries of transphobia-driven IPV with the explicit intention of new scale development; and (2) to examine the degree to which existing trans-focused IPV measurement scales adequately assess the construct. We recruited US-based, English-speaking trans survivors of IPV, aged 18 years and older, online through community-based organizations and Facebook/Instagram advertising. Twenty people participated in the study, of which 60 percent were white, 55 percent were assigned female at birth, and 60 percent were nonbinary. Through thematic analysis of the 20 in-depth interviews, we identified four subdomains of transphobia-driven IPV: pressure to perform, disrupting gender affirmation, belittling gender identity, and intentional misgendering. When examining nine existing screening tools and measures that ask about IPV related to the survivor's trans identity, only one measure included questions related to all four subdomains. Further, the existing measures were either not psychometrically validated, only validated with a subpopulation of the trans community, or validated with a larger LGBTQ sample of which trans survivors comprised a small percentage. This study lays a foundation for new valid measures of transphobia-driven IPV that reflect the various ways in which transphobia can be leveraged by abusers and may be relevant across subpopulations of the trans community.",2023,12,19
The influence of perceptions of gender discrimination in the workplace on depressive symptoms among Korean working women: The moderating role of job satisfaction.,"While previous research has primarily examined the mental health implications of experiencing racial or gender discrimination in the workplace within a Western context, there remains a gap in understanding the impact of perceptions of workplace gender discrimination (WGD) on mental health in Asian countries. Additionally, the potential moderating role of job satisfaction in this relationship is yet to be thoroughly explored.",2023,12,23
Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals association of aberrant placental trophoblasts and FN1 reduction in late-onset fetal growth restriction.,"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) can lead to fetal mental development abnormalities, malformations, and even intrauterine death. Defects in the trophoblasts at the maternal-fetal interface may contribute to FGR. However, the impact of trophoblasts on FGR is still not well understood. Therefore, the objective of this study is to characterize the heterogeneity of placental cells at the single-cell level and investigate the role of trophoblast subtypes in the pathogenesis of FGR at the cellular and molecular levels.",2023,12,28

PFOS exposure destroys the integrity of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) through PI3K/AKT/mTOR-mediated autophagy.,"Perfluorooctanesulfonate or perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), a type of perfluorinated compound, is mainly found in consumer products. Exposure to PFOS could cause male reproductive toxicity by causing injury to the blood-testis barrier (BTB). However, the specific mechanisms through which PFOS affects male reproduction remain unclear. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a vital protein kinase that is believed to be a central regulator of autophagy. In this study, we established in vivo and in vitro models to explore the effects of PFOS on the BTB, autophagy, and the regulatory role of the mTOR signaling pathway. Adult mice were developmentally exposed to 0, 0.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg/day PFOS for five weeks. Thereafter, their testicular morphology, sperm counts, serum testosterone, expression of BTB-related proteins, and autophagy-related proteins were evaluated. Additionally, TM4 cells (a mouse Sertoli cell line) were used to delineate the molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of PFOS on BTB. Our results demonstrated that exposure to PFOS induced BTB injury and autophagy, as evidenced by increased expression of autophagy-related proteins, accumulation of autophagosomes, observed through representative electron micrographs, and decreased activity of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Moreover, treatment with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, alleviated the effects of PFOS on the integrity of TM4 cells in the BTB and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Overall, this study highlights that exposure to PFOS destroys the integrity of the BTB through PI3K/AKT/mTOR-mediated autophagy.",2023,12,30
Three-dimensional morphology of bovine blastocysts hatched against lipopolysaccharide exposure in vitro.,"Embryo transfer in cattle is globally becoming more ubiquitous, but the pregnancy rate is lower than that of artificial insemination. The uterus contains its own bacteria, and concentrations of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria are higher in uteri affected by endometritis than in healthy uteri and they suppress embryogenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the morphological characteristics of bovine embryos with a higher viability and implantability, by analyzing the morphology of bovine blastocysts that successfully hatched under challenge of LPS, using an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. Developing embryos produced by in vitro fertilization that had reached the blastocyst stage on Day 7 were three-dimensionally scanned using an OCT system, then were continued to culture with or without LPS until Day 9, when the presence or absence of hatching was determined. The OCT-captured three-dimensional images were used to quantify 20 different metrics, including inner cell mass (ICM), trophectoderm, blastocoel, and total embryo volume; each of the parameters was compared between the hatched and unhatched embryos. Under the LPS challenge, hatched embryos had higher ICM thickness and volume, and lower trophectoderm thickness than unhatched embryos. Furthermore, hatched embryos under LPS challenge had higher ICM thickness and ICM volume than hatched embryos without LPS challenge. The present results suggest the possibility that ICM thickness and ICM volume calculated by OCT system could be indices for good quality bovine embryos.",2023,12,30
Development and comparison of parallel reaction monitoring and data-independent acquisition methods for quantitative analysis of hydrophilic compounds in white tea.,"In the present work, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods were developed for the accurate quantitation of amino acids, alkaloids nucleosides and nucleotides in tea. The quality peaks were significantly enhanced by optimizing the LC elution procedure, HCD voltage, MS resolution, and scanning event. Both methods were validated with good liner linearity (0.004-200 μg/mL), LODs (0.001-0.309 μg/mL for PRM and 0.001-0.564 μg/mL for DIA). Applied to white tea sample, the contents of these hydrophilic compounds were range from 34,655.39 to 70,586.14 mg/kg, and caffeine (32,529.02 mg/kg) and theanine (5483.46 mg/kg) were determined as the most abundant ones. Based on the quantitation data set, the white tea samples from Puer, Lincang and Xishuangbanna were clearly discriminated using multivariate data analysis. The results of the present works show that PRM and DIA have great potential in quantitative analysis of multiple hydrophilic compounds in food samples.",2023,12,22

MicroRNAs in Tetrahymena thermophila: An epigenetic regulatory mechanism in the response to cadmium stress.,"Among the epigenetic mechanisms based on non-coding RNA are microRNAs (miRNAs) that are involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs. In many organisms, the expression of genes involved in the cellular response to biotic or abiotic stress depends on the regulation, generally inhibitory, performed by miRNAs. For the first time in the eukaryotic microorganism (ciliate-model) Tetrahymena thermophila, miRNAs involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of transcripts linked to the response to cadmium have been isolated and analyzed. Forty de novo miRNAs (we named tte-miRNAs) have been isolated from control and Cd-treated populations (1 or 24 h exposures). An exhaustive comparative analysis of the features of these mature tte-miRNAs and their precursor sequences (pre-tte-miRNAs) confirms that they are true miRNAs. In addition to the three types of miRNA isoforms previously described in other organisms, two new types are also described among the tte-miRNAs studied. A certain percentage of the pre-tte-miRNA sequences are in introns from genes with many introns, and have been defined as 5', 3'-tailed mirtrons. A qRT-PCR analysis of selected tte-miRNAs together with some of their targets has validated them. Cd is one of the most toxic metals for the cell, which must defend itself against its toxicity by various mechanisms, such as expulsion by membrane pumps, chelation by metallothioneins, among others. Like other toxic metals, Cd also causes a well-known series of cellular effects such as intense proteotoxicity. Many of the targets that are regulated by the tte-miRNAs are transcripts encoding proteins that fit into these defense mechanisms and toxic metal effects.",2023,12,13
Increases in prosociality across adulthood: The pure-altruism hypothesis.,"A growing body of research suggests that prosocial behavior increases across adulthood. Yet, whether these age differences reflect ""pure altruistic"" or selfish motives, or the developmental mechanisms that underlie them, are largely unknown. Within a value-based decision framework, pure altruistic tendencies can be measured and distinguished from impure altruistic motives through neural-level information. Indeed, age differences in donations appear to be driven by a genuine concern for the well-being of others. Candidate mechanisms behind such pure altruistic changes need to show documented age differences and evidence of causal links to prosocial behavior. As examples, we discuss how three factors that meet these criteria--social norms, mood, and cognitive functioning--might explain age differences in pure altruistic tendencies.",2023,12,14
"Radioactivity levels, soil-to-grass and grass-to-milk transfer factor of natural radionuclides from grazing area in Erbil governorate, Iraq.","The levels of naturally occurring radionuclides in soil, grass, and milk were measured in this study in order to calculate the transfer factor of radionuclides from soil to grass and grass to milk obtained from Erbil governorate in Iraq.

Multifunctional Eu<sup>3+</sup>-MOF for simultaneous quantification of malachite green and leuco-malachite green and efficient adsorption of malachite green.,"Multi-target detection combined with in-situ removal of contaminants is a challenging issue difficult to overcome. Herein, a dual-emissive Eu<sup>3+</sup>-metal organic framework (Eu<sup>3+</sup>-MOF) was constructed by pre-functionalization with a blue-emissive ligand and post-functionalization with red-emissive Eu<sup>3+</sup> ions using a UiO-66 precursor. The fluorescence of the synthesized Eu<sup>3+</sup>-MOF is highly selective and sensitive toward malachite green (MG) and its metabolite leuco-malachite green (LMG), which are environmentally persistent and highly toxic to humans. The limit of detection of MG and LMG are 34.20 and 1.98 nM, respectively. Interestingly, the fluorescence of this Eu<sup>3+</sup>-MOF showed ratiometric but different responsive modes toward MG and LMG, which enabled the simultaneous quantification of MG and LMG. Furthermore, a paper-based sensor combined with the smartphone was fabricated, which facilitated not only the dual-channel detection of MG, but also its portable, visual, rapid, and intelligent determination. Furthermore, the high surface area of MOFs, together with the coordinate bonding interaction, π-π stacking, and electrostatic interaction sites, endows Eu<sup>3+</sup>-MOF with the efficient ability toward MG removal. This multifunctional Eu<sup>3+</sup>-MOF can be successfully used for trace detection, simultaneous determination of MG and LMG, as well as efficient removal of MG. Thus, it exhibits bright prospects for widespread applications in the field of food and environmental analysis.",2023,12,28
Contribution of serum elements to blood pressure during pregnancy by impacting gut microbiota: A prospective cohort study.,"Exposure to environmental elements can alter gut microbiota, further affecting host health. Exploring the interrelationships among element exposure, gut microbiota and blood pressure (BP) during pregnancy, as well as the mediating roles of gut microbiota, is warranted, which holds implications for maternal and offspring health. In a prospective cohort study between 2017-2018, 733 pregnant women were included. The serum elements and gut microbiota during the second trimester were assessed, and BP was collected during the second and third trimester and before delivery. Fourteen associations were identified between serum elements and BP, including positive associations of zinc (Zn) and thallium (Tl) with systolic BP during the second trimester. Rubidium (Rb) showed a positive association with Pielou's evenness. Serum elements, such as Tl and Rb, were significantly associated with the relative abundance of bacteria and co-abundance groups (CAGs). Alpha diversity was negatively associated with BP levels and trajectories. Moreover, 15 associations between gut microbiota and BP were shown. Finally, mediation analysis confirmed that CAG2 and Pielou's evenness mediated the associations of Tl and Rb with BP, respectively. We concluded that serum elements can contribute to BP changes during pregnancy through gut microbiota, suggesting gut microbiota-targeted approach as a potential intervention.",2023,12,27
Modified nano zero-valent iron coupling microorganisms to degrade BDE-209: Degradation pathways and microbial responses.,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in soil and groundwater have garnered considerable attention owing to the significant bioaccumulation potential and toxicity. Currently, the coupling treatment method of nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) with dehalogenation microorganisms is a research hotspot in the field of PBDE degradation. In this study, various systems were established within anaerobic environments, including the nZVI-only system, microorganism-only system, and the nZVI + microorganisms system. The aim was to investigate the degradation pathway of BDE-209 and elucidate the degradation mechanism within the coupled system. The results indicated that the degradation efficiency of the coupled system was better than that of the nZVI-only or microorganism-only system. Two modified nZVI (carboxymethyl cellulose and polyacrylamide) were prepared to improve the coupling degradation efficiency. CMC-nZVI showed the highest stability, and the coupled system consisting of microorganisms and CMC-nZVI showed the best degradation effect among all of the systems in this study, reaching 89.53% within 30 days. Furthermore, 22 intermediate products were detected in the coupling systems. Notably, changing the inoculation time did not significantly improve the degradation effect. The expression changes of the two reductive dehalogenase genes, e.g. TceA and Vcr, reflected the stress response and self-recovery ability of the dehalogenating bacteria, indicating such genes can be used as biomarker for evaluating the degradation performance of the coupling system. These findings provide a better understanding about the mechanism of coupling debromination process and the direction for the optimization and on-site repair of coupled systems.",2023,12,27
Inducing mutation and ascertaining lethal dosage of in vitro cultures of banana cv. Ney Poovan to ethyl methane sulfonate.,"In vitro mutation breeding in vegetatively propagated crops like banana offers a benefit in screening for beneficial variants in plant cells or cultured tissues. An attempt was made to induce mutants and determine the lethal dose, as it is the prerequisite to optimize the concentration and duration of the mutagen used to recover a larger population in mutation research. Shoot tip cultures were treated for 2 and 4 h at six different EMS concentrations ranging from 80 mM to 160 mM, whereas proliferating multiple shoots were exposed for 30 and 60 min at six different EMS concentrations ranging from 8 mM to 40 mM. Survival percentage, shoot length, and number of shoots reduced linearly and significantly as concentration and duration increased in both shoot tips and proliferating multiple buds. The probit curve-based analysis of mortality of treated explants revealed that the LD<sub>50</sub> was 155.83 mM for 2 h and 113.72 mM for 4 h, respectively for shoot tip cultures, whereas for proliferating multiple buds, the LD<sub>50</sub> value was adjusted to 39.11 mM for 30 min and 30.41 mM for 60 min. 160 mM EMS for 4 h resulted in a shorter shoot, a longer rooting duration, a lesser number of roots, and decreased root development. In proliferating multiple shoots, the smallest shoot, longest rooting duration, least number of roots, and shortest root were observed in 40 mM EMS for 60 min. Similar reductions in growth parameters were observed in proliferating multiple shoots at higher exposure to EMS for a longer duration.",2023,12,19
Sulfated polysaccharides accelerate gliadin digestion and reduce its toxicity.,"Celiac disease and other types of gluten intolerance significantly affect the life quality of patients making them restrict the diet removing all food produced from wheat, rye, oat, and barley flour, and some other products. These disorders arise from protease resistance of poorly soluble proteins prolamins, contained in gluten. Enhanced proteolytic digestion of gliadins might be considered as a prospective approach for the treatment of celiac disease and other types of gluten intolerance. Herein, we tested a range of sulfated polymers (kappa-carrageenan, dextran sulfate and different polysaccharides from brown seaweeds, and a synthetic polystyrene sulfonate) for the ability to activate gliadin digestion by human digestive proteases, pepsin and trypsin. Sulfated polysaccharide from Fucus evanescens enhanced proteolytic digestion of gliadins from wheat flour and reduced its cytotoxicity on intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cell culture. Regarding the non-toxic nature of fucoidans, the results provide a basis for polymer-based drugs or additives for the symptomatic treatment of gluten intolerance.",2023,12,26

QT prolongation predicts all-cause mortality above and beyond a validated risk score.,"QT prolongation is a risk factor for life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In large cohorts, QT interval was associated with all-cause mortality, but these analyses may contain residual confounding. Whether the QT interval provides prognostic information above and beyond a validated mortality risk score is unknown. We hypothesized that QT interval on ECG will independently predict mortality after adjustment for the Care Assessment Needs (CAN) score, which was validated to predict mortality nationwide at the Veterans Administration (VA) (c-index 0.86).",2023,12,26
A multi-sample evaluation of the measurement structure and function of the modified monetary incentive delay task in adolescents.,"Interpreting the neural response elicited during task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains a challenge in neurodevelopmental research. The monetary incentive delay (MID) task is an fMRI reward processing task that is extensively used in the literature. However, modern psychometric tools have not been used to evaluate measurement properties of the MID task fMRI data. The current study uses data for a similar task design across three adolescent samples (N = 346 [Age<sub>mean</sub> 12.0; 44 % Female]; N = 97 [19.3; 58 %]; N = 112 [20.2; 38 %]) to evaluate multiple measurement properties of fMRI responses on the MID task. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is used to evaluate an a priori theoretical model for the task and its measurement invariance across three samples. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is used to identify the data-driven measurement structure across the samples. CFA results suggest that the a priori model is a poor representation of these MID task fMRI data. Across the samples, the data-driven EFA models consistently identify a six-to-seven factor structure with run and bilateral brain region factors. This factor structure is moderately-to-highly congruent across the samples. Altogether, these findings demonstrate a need to evaluate theoretical frameworks for popular fMRI task designs to improve our understanding and interpretation of brain-behavior associations.",2023,12,28

Computational models and their applications in biomechanical analysis of mandibular reconstruction surgery.,"Advanced head and neck cancers involving the mandible often require surgical removal of the diseased parts and replacement with donor bone or prosthesis to recreate the form and function of the premorbid mandible. The degree to which this reconstruction successfully replicates key geometric features of the original bone critically affects the cosmetic and functional outcomes of speaking, chewing, and breathing. With advancements in computational power, biomechanical modeling has emerged as a prevalent tool for predicting the functional outcomes of the masticatory system and evaluating the effectiveness of reconstruction procedures in patients undergoing mandibular reconstruction surgery. These models offer cost-effective and patient-specific treatment tailored to the needs of individuals. To underscore the significance of biomechanical modeling, we conducted a review of 66 studies that utilized computational models in the biomechanical analysis of mandibular reconstruction surgery. The majority of these studies employed finite element method (FEM) in their approach; therefore, a detailed investigation of FEM has also been provided. Additionally, we categorized these studies based on the main components analyzed, including bone flaps, plates/screws, and prostheses, as well as their design and material composition.",2023,12,21
A deep learning framework for predicting molecular property based on multi-type features fusion.,"Extracting expressive molecular features is essential for molecular property prediction. Sequence-based representation is a common representation of molecules, which ignores the structure information of molecules. While molecular graph representation has a weak ability in expressing the 3D structure. In this article, we try to make use of the advantages of different type representations simultaneously for molecular property prediction. Thus, we propose a fusion model named DLF-MFF, which integrates the multi-type molecular features. Specifically, we first extract four different types of features from molecular fingerprints, 2D molecular graph, 3D molecular graph and molecular image. Then, in order to learn molecular features individually, we use four essential deep learning frameworks, which correspond to four distinct molecular representations. The final molecular representation is created by integrating the four feature vectors and feeding them into prediction layer to predict molecular property. We compare DLF-MFF with 7 state-of-the-art methods on 6 benchmark datasets consisting of multiple molecular properties, the experimental results show that DLF-MFF achieves state-of-the-art performance on 6 benchmark datasets. Moreover, DLF-MFF is applied to identify potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor from 2500 drugs. We predict probability of each drug being inferred as a 3CL protease inhibitor and also calculate the binding affinity scores between each drug and 3CL protease. The results show that DLF-MFF product better performance in the identification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor. This work is expected to offer novel research perspectives for accurate prediction of molecular properties and provide valuable insights into drug repurposing for COVID-19.",2023,12,28
Longitudinal changes in trunk acceleration and their relationship with gait parameters in post-stroke hemiplegic patients.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the longitudinal changes in trunk acceleration, gait speed, and paretic leg motion in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis, the relationships between variables at each time point, and whether initial trunk acceleration and gait parameters were related to gait speed 2 months later.",2023,12,30
The effects of galacto-oligosaccharides on faecal parameters in healthy dogs and cats.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) on faecal parameters in healthy dogs and cats. To this end, 20 dogs and 20 Domestic shorthair cats were fed a commercially available adult dog food, or cat food, respectively, with either syrup containing GOS (at 1% w galacto-oligosaccharides/w formulated feed) on top (test group) or no topping (control group) for 56 days in a cross-over design. The study consisted of 2 periods of 24 days adaptation, followed by 4 days of collection of faeces. Faecal samples were tested for moisture, nitrogen, pH, macronutrients, enzymes, and fermentation products. The faecal microbiota were analysed by 16S rDNA profiling. It appeared that GOS have different effects in dogs compared to cats. In dogs, the addition of GOS resulted in increased carbohydrate fermentation (increase of acetic and butyric acid), whereas in cats GOS resulted in increased amino acid fermentation (increase of isovaleric acid). The α-diversity of the canine faecal microbiota was reduced by dietary GOS (Inverse Simpson Index, p = 0.063; Shannon index, p = 0.035) whereas the α-diversity of cat faecal microbiota was unaffected (Inverse Simpson Index, p = 0.539; Shannon index, p = 0.872). Lachnospiraceae spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. positively responded to GOS in both cats and dogs. Lactobacillus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae spp. positively responded to GOS in dogs. In both dogs and cats, GOS may therefore improve stool microbiota and result in the production of specific metabolites that are beneficial to gut health.",2023,12,28
Clinicopathological and genetic landscape of plasmablastic lymphoma in Taiwan.,"Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is an aggressive large B-cell lymphoma with a terminal B-cell differentiation phenotype and is frequently associated with immunodeficiency. We aimed to investigate the clinicopathological and immunophenotypic features, genetic alterations, and mutational landscape of PBL in Taiwan. We retrospectively recruited 26 cases. Five (5/18; 28%) patients were HIV-positive and 21 (81%) presented extranodally. There were two morphological groups: one with purely monomorphic large cells (85%) and the other comprising large cells admixed with plasmacytic cells (15%). Phenotypically, the tumors expressed MYC (8/10; 80%), CD138 (20/26; 77%), and MUM1 (20/20; 100%), but not CD20 (n = 26; 0%). Fourteen (54%) cases were positive for EBV by in situ hybridization; the EBV-positive cases were more frequently HIV infected (p = 0.036), with extranodal presentation (p = 0.012) and CD79a expression (p = 0.012), but less frequent light chain restriction (p = 0.029). Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we identified 13q14 deletion, MYC rearrangement, and CCND1 rearrangement in 74%, 30%, and 5% cases, respectively, without any cases having rearranged BCL6 or IGH::FGFR3 fusion. In the 15 cases with adequate tissue for whole exome sequencing, the most frequent recurrent mutations were STAT3 (40%), NRAS (27%), and KRAS (20%). In conclusion, most PBL cases in Taiwan were HIV-unrelated. Around half of the cases were positive for EBV, with distinct clinicopathological features. Deletion of chromosome 13q14 was frequent. The PBL cases in Taiwan showed recurrent mutations involving JAK-STAT, RAS-MAPK, epigenetic regulation, and NOTCH signaling pathways, findings similar to that from the West.",2023,12,24
Reusable mechano-bactericidal surface with echinoid-shaped hierarchical micro/nano-structure.,"Biofilms formed owing to the attachment of bacteria to surfaces have caused various problems in industries such as marine transportation/logistics and medicine. In response, many studies have been conducted on bactericidal surfaces, and nanostructured surfaces mimicking cicada and dragonfly wings are emerging as candidates for mechano-bactericidal surfaces. In specific circumstances involving mechano-bactericidal activity, certain nanostructured surfaces could exhibit their bactericidal effects by directly deforming the membranes of bacteria that adhere to these nanostructures. Additionally, in most cases, debris of bacterial cells may accumulate on these nanostructured surfaces. Such accumulation poses a significant challenge: it diminishes the mechano-bactericidal effectiveness of the surface, as it hinders the direct interaction between the nanostructures and any new bacteria that attach subsequently. In specific circumstances involving mechano-bactericidal activity, certain nanostructured surfaces could exhibit their bactericidal effects by directly deforming the membranes of bacteria that adhere to these nanostructures. Additionally, in most cases, debris of bacterial cells may accumulate on these nanostructured surfaces. Such accumulation poses a significant challenge: it diminishes the mechano-bactericidal effectiveness of the surface, as it hinders the direct interaction between the nanostructures and any new bacteria that attach subsequently.In other words, there is a need for strategies to remove the accumulated bacterial debris in order to sustain the mechano-bactericidal effect of the nanostructured surface. In this study, hierarchical micro/nano-structured surface (echinoid-shaped nanotextures were formed on Al micro-particle's surfaces) was fabricated using a simple pressure-less sintering method, and effective bactericidal efficiency was shown against E. coli (97 ± 3.81%) and S. aureus (80 ± 9.34%). In addition, thermal cleaning at 500 °C effectively eliminated accumulated dead bacterial debris while maintaining the intact Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanostructure, resulting in significant mechano-bactericidal activity (E. coli: 89 ± 6.86%, S. aureus: 75 ± 8.31%). As a result, thermal cleaning maintains the intact nanostructure and allows the continuance of the mechano-bactericidal effect. This effect was consistently maintained even after five repetitive use (E. coli: 80 ± 16.26%, S. aureus: 76 ± 12.67%).",2023,12,25
Translation and validation of a Chinese version of the Appearance Schemas Inventory-Revised in Chinese adults.,"The current study translated the Appearance Schemas Inventory-Revised (ASI-R) into Chinese (Mandarin) and examined its psychometric properties in Chinese adult women and men. Sample 1 included 400 women and 400 men to examine the factor structure of the ASI-R with exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Sample 2 involved 300 women and 300 men, and the EFA-derived factor structures in Sample 1 of the ASI-R were examined with exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), bifactor ESEM (B-ESEM), and bifactor ESEM with correlated uniqueness for negatively worded items (B-ESEM-CU) for both women and men. Results of the EFA identified a 4-factor model in women and a 2-factor model in men. The B-ESEM-CU consistently showed the best model fit. In the B-ESEM-CU, the general factor was well-defined, but the specific factors were not, supporting the use of the global factor to conceptualize the ASI-R for Chinese women and men. Evidence of adequate internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity of the global factor of the ASI-R was suggested in both women and men. Findings suggest the ASI-R is a useful instrument to measure body image investment in Chinese women and men, specifically using the B-ESEM-CU to understand the dimensionality of the ASI-R.",2023,12,30
Efficient quality assurance for isocentric stability in stereotactic body radiation therapy using machine learning.,"This study aims to predict isocentric stability for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatments using machine learning (ML), covers the challenges of manual assessment and computational time for quality assurance (QA), and supports medical physicists to enhance accuracy. The isocentric parameters for collimator (C), gantry (G), and table (T) tests were conducted with the RUBY phantom during QA using TrueBeam linac for SBRT. This analysis combined statistical features from the IsoCheck EPID software. Five ML models, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), naive Bayes (NB), and support vector machines (SVM), were used to predict the outcome of the QA procedure. 247 Winston-Lutz (WL) tests were collected from 2020 to 2022. In our study, both DT and RF achieved the highest score on test accuracy (Acc. test) ranging from 93.5% to 99.4%, and area under curve (AUC) values from 90 to 100% on three modes (C, G, and T). The precision, recall, and F1 scores indicate the DT model consistently outperforms other ML models in predicting isocenter stability deviation in QA. The QA assessment using ML models can assist error prediction early to avoid potential harm during SBRT and ensure safe and effective patient treatments.",2023,12,31
The influence of silver nanoparticles on the process of epithelial transition in the context of cancer metastases.,"Exposure to nanoparticles (NPs) can occur in a variety of occupational situations. Ultrafine particles of natural and anthropological origin toxicity has been described in epidemiological studies. Meanwhile, the risks associated with NPs exposure are not comprehensively assessed. A wide spectrum of NPs toxicity has been demonstrated, mainly through the induction of oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators. Among the newly described mechanisms of NPs toxicity is the induction of fibrosis via the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is also a key mechanism of cancer metastasis. The effect of NPs on EMT in the context of metastasis has not been sufficiently described so far, and the results of studies do not allow for the formulation of unambiguous conclusions. Therefore, the aim of the work was to determine the biological activity of silver NPs against MDA-MB-436 triple-negative breast cancer cells.",2023,12,22
[Assessment of the suitability of selected non-measuring models for dermal exposure estimation for the purposes of assessing compliance of working conditions with restrictions 71 and 76 in Annex XVII of the REACH regulation].,"Occupational exposure to chemicals occurs mainly through inhalation and the skin. The inhalation exposure assessment is regulated by law, while in Poland the method of conducting measurements for dermal exposure has not been indicated in the law. However, due to the restrictions 71 and 76 from Annex XVII of REACH for 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and <i>N,N</i>-dimethylformamide (DMF), exposure assessment by the dermal route is necessary. These restrictions require to ensure that exposure of workers is below the derived no-effect levels (DNELs) for dermal exposure.

Deaf patients' preferred communication in clinical settings: implications for healthcare providers.,"Deaf patients who communicate in American Sign Language (ASL) experience communication challenges leading to medical errors, treatment delays, and health disparities. Research on Deaf patient communication preferences is sparse. Researchers conducted focus groups based on the Health Belief Model with culturally Deaf patients and interpreters. The ASL focus groups were interpreted and transcribed into written English, verified by a third-party interpreting agency, and uploaded into NVivo. Deductive coding was used to identify communication methods and inductive coding was used to identify themes within each. Writing back-and-forth introduced challenges related to English proficiency, medical terminology, poor penmanship, and tendencies of providers to abbreviate. Participants had various speechreading abilities and described challenges with mask mandates. Multiple issues were identified with family and friends as proxy interpreters, including a lack of training, confidentiality issues, emotional support, and patient autonomy. Video remote interpreter challenges included technical, environmental, and interpreter qualification concerns. Participants overwhelmingly preferred on-site interpreters for communication clarity. While there was a preference for direct care, many acknowledged this is not always feasible due to lack of providers fluent in ASL. Access to on-site interpreters is vital for many Deaf patients to provide full access to critical medical information. Budget allocation for on-call interpreters is important in emergency settings.",2023,12,31

Intrauterine devices are a safe form of contraception in users with solid organ transplantation: A single-center experience.,"Patients who undergo organ transplantation are advised to use contraception for health optimization, yet limited data exists on safe contraceptive options for this population. This study investigates the infection risk of intrauterine devices (IUDs) in patients who have received a solid organ transplant by evaluating the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). We performed a retrospective chart review of subjects with a solid organ transplant who used an IUD between the years of January 2007 to February 2021. We included subjects ages 22-55 years at the time of IUD placement. We abstracted demographic information, transplant type, IUD type, immunosuppressive medications, screening for sexually transmitted infections, and diagnosis of PID. We identified 29 subjects that met the inclusion criteria. Six subjects had a copper IUD (21%) and 23 had a levonorgestrel IUD (79%). The most common organ transplanted was a kidney (n = 10) and liver (n = 10) while five subjects had multiple organs transplanted. Twenty-five (86.2%) subjects took immunosuppressive medications at the time of IUD insertion. Twenty-four (82.8%) patients had their IUD placed after transplantation. The average time of IUD use was 2.5 years. . In our study of IUD use in patients with solid organ transplantation, no patients developed PID. IUDs are a safe contraceptive option for immunosuppressed transplant patients.",2023,12,31
"Function analysis and characterisation of a novel chitinase, MdCht9, in Musca domestica.","Insect chitinases have been proposed as potential targets for pest control. In this work, a novel group IV chitinase gene, MdCht9, from Musca domestica was found to have multiple functions in the physiological activity, including chitin regulation, development and antifungal immunity. The MdCht9 gene was cloned and sequenced, its phylogeny was analysed and its expression was determined in normal and 20E treated larvae. Subsequently, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated MdCht9 knockdown was performed, followed by biochemical assays, morphological observations and transcriptome analysis. Finally, the recombinant protein MdCht9 (rMdCht9) was purified and tested for anti-microbial activity and enzyme characteristics. The results showed that MdCht9 consists of three domains, highly expressed in a larval salivary gland. RNAi silencing of MdCht9 resulted in significant down-regulation of chitin content and expression of 15 chitin-binding protein (CBP) genes, implying a new insight that MdCht9 might regulate chitin content by influencing the expression of CBPs. In addition, more than half of the lethality and partial wing deformity appeared due to the dsMdCht9 treatment. In addition, the rMdCht9 exhibited anti-microbial activity towards Candida albicans (fungus) but not towards Escherichia coli (G-) or Staphylococcus aureus (G+). Our work expands on previous studies of chitinase while providing a potential target for pest management.",2023,12,31
The mineralocorticoid receptor forms higher order oligomers upon DNA binding.,"The prevailing model of steroid hormone nuclear receptor function assumes ligand-induced homodimer formation followed by binding to DNA hormone response elements (HREs). This model has been challenged by evidence showing that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) forms tetramers upon ligand and DNA binding, which then drive receptor-mediated gene transactivation and transrepression. GR and the closely-related mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) interact to transduce corticosteroid hormone signaling, but whether they share the same quaternary arrangement is unknown. Here, we used a fluorescence imaging technique, Number & Brightness, to study oligomerization in a cell system allowing real-time analysis of receptor-DNA interactions. Agonist-bound MR forms tetramers in the nucleoplasm and higher order oligomers upon binding to HREs. Antagonists form intermediate-size quaternary arrangements, suggesting that large oligomers are essential for function. Divergence between MR and GR quaternary structure is driven by different functionality of known and new multimerization interfaces, which does not preclude formation of heteromers. Thus, influencing oligomerization may be important to selectively modulate corticosteroid signaling.",2023,12,31
Methionol as an aggregation-sex pheromone of the desert-dwelling beetle Eustromula valida (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae).,"As part of a long-term project on unraveling the use of pheromones in the large beetle family Cerambycidae, field trials were conducted with generic blends of known cerambycid pheromones at a desert site in southern California. In the first year of testing (2022), the species Eustromula valida (LeConte) (subfamily Cerambycinae, tribe Elaphidiini) and Aethecerinus latecinctus (Horn) (Cerambycinae, Trachyderini) were weakly attracted to one of the lure blends. In follow-up trials in 2023, only E. valida were caught, and collection of volatiles from both sexes of E. valida determined that males sex-specifically produced 3-methylthiopropan-1-ol (methionol), a compound that was not in the tested lure blends. Beetles of both sexes were strongly and specifically attracted to this compound in field bioassays, verifying that it is an aggregation-sex pheromone. No sympatric species were attracted to methionol while it was deployed in the field. Several recent studies have identified methionol as a pheromone component for other cerambycid species in both North and South America, suggesting it may represent another common pheromone component within the Cerambycidae.",2023,12,31
Effects of Long-term Different-scale Rice-duck Farming on the Growth and Yield of Paddy Rice.,"To maintain rice production and increase revenue, rice-duck (RD) farming is a contemporary ecological cycle technology that has been widely used in Asia.

Application value of serum S100B combined with glucose metabolism indexes in predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes of patients with severe preeclampsia.,"S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) and glucose control are reflective of maternal-fetal risks. We investigated the value of serum S100B combined with fasting blood glucose (FBG)/hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in evaluating the pregnancy outcomes of patients with severe preeclampsia (SPE). The clinical characteristics of SPE patients/controls were collected. FBG/HbA1c and serum S100B levels were measured, with their correlations analyzed. SPE patients were subdivided into adverse/non-adverse outcome groups based on follow-up results. The value of different indexes in predicting pregnancy outcomes was analyzed. SPE patients showed higher systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, urine protein, and body mass index and lower platelets, gestational age at delivery, and infant birth weight than healthy controls. FBG and HbA1c were positively correlated with serum S100B. SPE patients with adverse outcomes exhibited increased serum S100B and FBG/HbA1c levels. The area under the curve of serum S100B + FBG/HbA1c in evaluating adverse pregnancy outcomes of SPE patients was 0.8412 (77.05% sensitivity/84.21% specificity), higher than either alone. Serum S100B and FBG/HbA1c were independent risk factors for adverse outcomes of SPE patients. Overall, serum S100B positively-correlates with FBG/HbA1c in SPE patients. Serum S100B and FBG/HbA1c are independent risk factors, and their combination has high value on predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes of SPE patients.",2023,12,30
Drug-induced secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in hairy cell leukaemia.,"Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, aggressive, excess immune activation syndrome. Diagnosis can be challenging due to its several clinical mimics including sepsis. There are multiple aetiologies of HLH; in adults, it is most commonly triggered by infection, malignancy, drugs and autoimmune processes. Failure to rapidly diagnose and treat this condition can be fatal. The management of HLH includes identifying and removing the trigger, supportive management and immunosuppression. Identifying the trigger is essential to inform the most appropriate type of immunosuppression. Here, we report a case of likely drug-induced HLH in a patient recently treated for hairy cell leukaemia. The culprit drug was thought to be co-trimoxazole and this case report highlights a very rare complication of this commonly used drug. We discuss our management approach with steroid monotherapy and withdrawal of co-trimoxazole.",2023,12,30
Open Versus Thoracoscopic Repair of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia: A 19-year Review in a Tertiary Referral Centre in Hong Kong.,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a developmental defect that causes herniation of abdominal organs into the thoracic cavity with significant morbidity. Thoracoscopic repair of CDH is an increasingly prevalent yet controversial surgical technique, with limited long-term outcome data in the Asian region. The aim of this study was to compare open laparotomy versus thoracoscopic repair of CDH in paediatric patients in a major tertiary referral centre in Asia.",2023,12,09
Muscle Flap Technique Safe for On-ECMO Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Repair.,Prosthetic patches (patch) and muscle flaps (flap) are techniques used for repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) with a large defect unamenable to primary closure. We hypothesized that the flap technique for CDH repair while on extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (on-ECMO) would have decreased bleeding complications compared to patch due to the hemostatic advantage of native tissue.,2023,12,08
Fire ecology in marine systems.,"Wildfire byproducts enter into the oceans via terrestrial and atmospheric routes.

Potential Applications of New Headsets for Virtual and Augmented Reality in Urology.,"Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) technologies hold great promise in various medical fields. The release of a new generation of headsets for medical enhanced VR/AR (MER) opens new possibilities for applications in medicine, particularly in urology, to improve accessibility to everyone. These innovative headsets offer deep immersion without requiring a controller, which represents a novel approach to VR/AR engagement. The potential of these headsets applies to all aspects of urology, including surgical training, virtual meetings, communication between health care providers, patient counseling, telemedicine, delivering patient advice, and pain control. MER has the potential to improve operative planning and enhance intraoperative navigation and spatial awareness. The surgeon's visualization and overall experience can be significantly enhanced via improved guidance and visualization, ultimately leading to greater precision and safety. This cutting-edge technology has the potential to reshape urology practice, communication methods, and medical procedures, and ultimately to improve patients' experience of their urological condition. PATIENT SUMMARY: This mini review explores how a new generation of headsets for medical enhanced virtual reality could revolutionize urology by improving surgical planning, assistance during procedures, and medical education. Patients can benefit from better pain management and a deeper understanding of their conditions. However, challenges such as costs, accuracy, and ethical concerns must be addressed. This technology holds promise for transforming urological practice and patient care.",2023,12,29
Primary repair with no flaps for lower lip defects (30-80 %) after cancer excision.,"Reconstruction of the lip is a necessary procedure when lip tumors are excised. Although many good techniques have been described, they often have disadvantages such as necrosis and extensive suture lines. In our approach, we aim to minimize the suture line and avoid tissue necrosis for medium-sized lip defects (30-80 %). This is a surgical technique report from a single center. After tumor resection, we made a bilateral 15 mm horizontal skin and mucosa incision from the angles of the lip to the lateral sides. The mucosa and skin were dissected from the underlying muscle, and the muscle was cut approximately 15 mm on each side. The lip defect was then closed and sutured in four layers. Finally, the released mucosa was sutured to the corner of the incised skin. We followed the patients for 36 months and found that their speech intelligibility, sensation, mobility, and aesthetic satisfaction were preserved. The scars were also less pronounced compared to flaps, and there were no signs of edema or drooling. In conclusion, our technique offers many advantages for moderate defects of lower lip tumors. By avoiding the use of flaps, we eliminate the complications associated with flap surgery while achieving aesthetically satisfactory results. However, further evaluation by other surgeons is necessary to fully examine the technique's benefits.",2023,12,29
Completion of adjuvant S-1 chemotherapy after surgical resection for biliary tract cancer: A single center experience.,"A recent randomized control trial (JCOG1202; ASCOT trial) demonstrated the efficacy of adjuvant S-1 chemotherapy (ASC) for biliary tract cancer (BTC) after surgical resection; however, the significance of the completion of ASC in the real-world setting remains unknown.",2023,12,29
Quo Vadis Hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C MRI?,"Over the last two decades, hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C MRI has gained significance in both preclinical and clinical studies, hereby relying on technologies like PHIP-SAH (ParaHydrogen-Induced Polarization-Side Arm Hydrogenation), SABRE (Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange), and dDNP (dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization), with dDNP being applied in humans. A clinical dDNP polarizer has enabled studies across 24 sites, despite challenges like high cost and slow polarization. Parahydrogen-based techniques like SABRE and PHIP offer faster, more cost-efficient alternatives but require molecule-specific optimization. The focus has been on imaging metabolism of hyperpolarized probes, which requires long T<sub>1</sub>, high polarization and rapid contrast generation. Efforts to establish novel probes, improve acquisition techniques and enhance data analysis methods including artificial intelligence are ongoing. Potential clinical value of hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C MRI was demonstrated primarily for treatment response assessment in oncology, but also in cardiology, nephrology, hepatology and CNS characterization. In this review on biomedical hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C MRI, we summarize important and recent advances in polarization techniques, probe development, acquisition and analysis methods as well as clinical trials. Starting from those we try to sketch a trajectory where the field of biomedical hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C MRI might go.",2023,12,29

[Myocardial Infarction with no obstructive coronary arteries: Imaging plays a central role].,"Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary lesion (MINOCA) represents a non-negligible percentage of the proportion of myocardial infarctions (≈6%). Moreover, the long-term prognosis is poor, with an annual mortality rate of 2%. This high mortality rate may be explained by the fact that MINOCA represents a heterogeneous group, and the diagnosis of pathology is poorly understood. It is essential to be aware of this clinical presentation, and to follow the different diagnostic strategies, in order to identify the etiological mechanism, and thus set up a suitable treatment. Many tools are available to support diagnosis, notably in the fields of imaging, the principal contributors being coronary angiography, coronary physiology and pharmacological testing, as well as endo-coronary imaging and cardiac MRI. This review will provide an update on the definition, epidemiology, diagnostic strategies and treatment options for patients with MINOCA.",2023,12,29
Prognostic Value of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and RCA Pericoronary Adipose Tissue CT Attenuation in Patients with Acute Chest Pain.,"Pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) CT attenuation of right coronary artery (RCA) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have prognostic value for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with coronary artery disease. However, the superior prognostic value between RCA PCAT CT attenuation and NAFLD remains unclear in patients with acute chest pain. This study is to evaluate the prognostic value of NAFLD for MACE, and further assess the incremental prognostic value of NAFLD over PCAT CT attenuation.",2023,12,29
Comparative evaluation of different spinal stability metrics.,"Direct in vivo measurements of spinal stability are not possible, leaving computational estimations (such as dynamic time series and structural analyses) as the feasible option. However, differences between different stability assessment approaches and metrics remain unclear. To explore this, we asked 32 participants to perform 35 cycles of repetitive lifts with and without load (4/2.6 kg for males/females). EMG signals and 3D kinematics were collected via 12 surface electrodes and 17 inertial sensors, and three dynamical stability measures were computed: short and long temporal and conventional maximum Lyapunov exponents (LyE) and maximum Floquet multipliers (FM). A dynamic subject-specific EMG-assisted musculoskeletal model computed four structural stability measures (critical muscle stiffness coefficient at which spine becomes unstable, average spine stiffness, minimum and geometric average of Hessian matrix eigenvalues). Across cycles, dynamical and structural stability outcomes varied noticeably. Temporal short-term LyE and all structural stability measures were more influenced by the cycle percentage (posture factor) than by phase (lifting, lowering) or load factor. The effect of all factors were non-significant for FM and long LyE, except for the posture on LyE-L with a small effect size. Pearson's correlations revealed a weak to moderate, or non-existent, correlation between structural and dynamical stability metrics, with small shared variances, underscoring their distinct and independent nature and theoretical foundations. Moreover, the low sensitivity of dynamic measures to posture and load factors, found in this study, calls for further examination. Considering the limitations and shortcomings of both dynamical and structural stability assessment approaches, there is a need for the development of improved musculoskeletal stability evaluation techniques.",2023,12,21
Nonsingleton Gaussian type-3 fuzzy system with fractional order NTSMC for path tracking of autonomous cars.,"Path-tracking and lane-keeping tasks are critical to guarantee safety and navigation performance considerations for deploying autonomous cars. This paper presents a novel control framework for the path-tracking control of high-speed autonomous cars with structured uncertainties. This study introduces a nonlinear adaptive control system based on a fractional-order terminal sliding mode system while incorporating a novel Gaussian Nonsingleton type-3 fuzzy system (FOTSM-NT3FS). Therefore, the proposed controller is independent of the information about the ego vehicle's dynamic information, and instead, the dynamics are approximated through a developed NT3FLS. The developed control system exhibits robustness to measurement errors and faulty sensors, because the inputs to the NT3FS are uncertain. In order to guarantee the boundedness of the adaptation parameters, the σ-mod approach is employed. The Lyapunov stability theorem and Barbalat's lemma are used to ensure the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed loop system and the convergence of tracking errors to the origin in finite time. High-fidelity co-simulations with CarSim and MATLAB are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme and are also compared to other reported methods in the literature. Based on the obtained results, the schemed controller exhibits competitive effectiveness in path-tracking tasks and strong efficiency under various road conditions, parametric uncertainties, and unknown disturbances.",2023,12,28
Association between language discordance and unplanned hospital readmissions or emergency department revisits: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Studies conflict about whether language discordance increases rates of hospital readmissions or emergency department (ED) revisits for adult and paediatric patients.

Fetal survival in pregnancy complicated by massive subchorionic thrombohaematoma.,"This case involves a pregnant patient in her late 20s whose pregnancy was complicated by placentamegaly and early-onset, severe fetal growth restriction (FGR). Investigations ruled out genetic and infectious aetiologies. The pregnancy eventually was further complicated by abnormal umbilical artery blood flow. Shared decision-making with the patient and obstetrical team led to delivery by caesarean section at 28 weeks and 4 days. The baby was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit but, overall, did well. Placental pathology revealed a massive subchorionic thrombohaematoma (MST). This case highlights the importance of early detection, evaluation and management of pregnancies complicated by severe FGR as well as the significance of shared decision-making with patients. We aim to increase the awareness of MST in the differential diagnosis of placentamegaly, as this finding in combination with early and severe FGR has been shown to be a poor prognostic factor for the fetus.",2023,12,30
Diabetic striatopathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus: a rare conundrum.,"Diabetic striatopathy is a clinicoradiological syndrome characterised by acute hyperkinetic movement disorder in the form of hemichorea-hemiballism with basal ganglia abnormalities in neuroimaging. The hallmark basal ganglia abnormalities appear as hyperdensities in CT brain and hyperintensities in MRI brain, which could mislead the clinician towards an erroneous diagnosis of cerebral haemorrhage. It is classically described in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and its occurrence in type 1 diabetes is extremely rare. This case report entails the clinical details of a young man in his 20s with type 1 diabetes mellitus who had uncontrolled blood glucose levels and presented with a recent onset of abnormal movements in his left upper and lower limbs. The semiology, biochemistry and radiological investigation findings and treatment are detailed. A clear understanding of the condition could lead to an early diagnosis, spare the patient unnecessary investigations and improve treatment outcomes.",2023,12,30
The 'corkscrew' sign: an indirect MRI hint for intracranial venous hypertension.,"Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are intracranial vascular abnormalities in which one or more meningeal arteries shunt into a venous structure, either a cortical vein or a venous sinus, causing cerebral venous hypertension and risk of haemorrhage. Imaging diagnosis and characterisation are of paramount importance to grade the haemorrhagic risk and direct management. Non-invasive vascular neuroimaging might pose a diagnostic suspicion, but invasive catheter digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is usually required. We present the case of a patient with an atypical acute cerebral haemorrhage in which admission imaging with CT angiography (CTA) and MR angiography (MRA) was unremarkable, while advanced morphological MR with susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) revealed specific findings suggesting unilateral chronic venous hypertension. Successively, DSA detected a small DAVF that was treated with endovascular embolization. This case report raises awareness on subtle but important conventional imaging findings that suggest the presence of an AV shunt, to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed treatment.",2023,12,30
The multifactorial aetiology and management of premenstrual dysphoric disorder with leuprorelin acetate.,"Up to 18% of women of reproductive age may experience symptoms during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or its more severe form, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). A plethora of symptoms have been described, but both are commonly associated with other mood-related disorders such as major depression causing significant life impairment. Originally known as late luteal phase dysphoric disorder in the DSM-III-R (American Psychiatric Association 1987), the syndrome was renamed PMDD in the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association 1994). Between 3% and 8% of women meet the diagnostic criteria for PMDD. Currently, there is no consensus on its aetiology although it is thought to be multifactorial. Biological, genetic, psychological, environmental and social factors have all been suggested. However, an altered sensitivity to the normal hormonal fluctuations that influence functioning of the central nervous system is thought most likely. PMDD is identified in the DSM-5 by the presence of at least five symptoms accompanied by significant psychosocial or functional impairment. During evaluation, it is recommended that clinicians confirm symptoms by prospective patient mood charting for at least two menstrual cycles. Management options include psychotropic agents, ovulation suppression and dietary modification. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered primary therapy for psychological symptoms. Ovulation suppression is another option with the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) or GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonists. Rarely symptoms warrant a bilateral oophorectomy and a 6-month trial of GnRH agonists prior to surgery may be prudent to determine its potential efficacy. The authors present the case of a multiparous woman in her mid-30s experiencing severe symptoms during the luteal phase of her menstrual cycle. A trial of the contraceptive pill and SSRIs were unsuccessful. Treatment with leuprorelin acetate (Prostap) improved her symptoms. She therefore elected to undergo a bilateral oophorectomy with resolution of her symptoms. She started hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This case demonstrates the multifactorial aetiology of PMDD and the challenges in its management. Women with PMDD suffer functional impairments comparable with other depressive disorders and yet PMDD and its impact remain under-recognised. As the psychological nature and consequences of PMDD often seem indistinguishable from symptoms of other mental health difficulties, this condition presents distinct diagnostic challenges for healthcare professionals. It is crucial to establish the correct diagnosis using clearly defined criteria because if it is left untreated, it can cause considerable impairment to the woman's quality of life.",2023,12,30
An unusual cause of acute coronary syndrome: thrombosis of right coronary artery to right atrium fistula.,"Coronary arterial fistulae are rare, but it is one of the most common coronary artery anomalies. Most of the cases are asymptomatic in younger patients unless it is large and of haemodynamic significance. The incidence of thromboembolic complications usually increases with age. We report a case of a young male in his early 20s presenting with central chest pain. Coronary computed tomographic angiography revealed acute coronary syndrome due to a fistula between right coronary artery and right atrium occluded by thrombus. After discussion with coronary and congenital heart multidisciplinary team, a consensus was agreed that we should manage him conservatively with anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy and a 3-month follow-up strategy that included repeating cardiac imaging. After a year, his anticoagulation and antiplatelet medication was discontinued.",2023,12,30
Massive fetomaternal haemorrhage warranting novel use of tandem isovolumetric partial exchange transfusion and therapeutic hypothermia.,"A newborn male infant was pale, hypotonic, and had respiratory distress after delivery. Venous cord blood gas revealed a severe metabolic acidosis. His initial examination was consistent with moderate encephalopathy and laboratory testing uncovered severe congenital anaemia (haematocrit 0.127 L/L). He met the clinical criteria for therapeutic hypothermia (TH) and required red blood cell transfusions, but due to the severity of his anaemia, an exchange transfusion was favoured to prevent transfusion-associated circulatory overload. There are no previous reports of these procedures completed in tandem, but the benefits were perceived to outweigh the risks. During the 72 hours of TH, the infant received an isovolumetric partial exchange transfusion and tolerated both treatments without any adverse clinical events.Kleihauer-Betke testing detected a massive chronic fetomaternal haemorrhage with 475 mL (164 mL/kg) of blood. A brain MRI completed prior to discharge was normal. At 6 months of age, he is growing and developing normally.",2023,12,30

Primary care nurse practitioner work environments and emergency department utilization among older adults with substance use disorders in rural areas.,"The prevalence of substance use disorders (SUDs) is growing among older adults, and older adults in rural areas face disparities in access to SUD care. Rural older adults with SUDs commonly have comorbid chronic conditions that puts them at risk for frequent acute healthcare utilization. In rural areas, primary care for patients with SUDs are increasingly provided by nurse practitioners (NPs), and quality primary care services may decrease ED visits in this population. Yet, NP-delivered primary care for rural older adults with SUDs may be limited by work environment barriers, which include lack of support, autonomy, and visibility. This study assessed the relationship between the NP work environment and ED utilization among rural older adults with SUDs.",2023,12,28
Interpersonal Mechanisms Between Child Maltreatment Timing and Young Adult Internalizing and Externalizing Symptomology.,"Children who experience maltreatment are prone to exhibit interpersonal deficits and lack secure attachment, which can lead to internalizing and externalizing symptomology.

The solute carrier SLC25A17 sustains peroxisomal redox homeostasis in diverse mammalian cell lines.,"Despite the crucial role of peroxisomes in cellular redox maintenance, little is known about how these organelles transport redox metabolites across their membrane. In this study, we sought to assess potential associations between the cellular redox landscape and the human peroxisomal solute carrier SLC25A17, also known as PMP34. This carrier has been reported to function as a counter-exchanger of adenine-containing cofactors such as coenzyme A (CoA), dephospho-CoA, flavin adenine dinucleotide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate, flavin mononucleotide, and adenosine monophosphate. We found that inactivation of SLC25A17 resulted in a shift toward a more reductive state in the glutathione redox couple (GSSG/GSH) across HEK-293 cells, HeLa cells, and SV40-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts, with variable impact on the NADPH levels and the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox couple. This phenotype could be rescued by the expression of Candida boidinii Pmp47, a putative SLC25A17 orthologue reported to be essential for the metabolism of medium-chain fatty acids in yeast peroxisomes. In addition, we provide evidence that the alterations in the redox state are not caused by changes in peroxisomal antioxidant enzyme expression, catalase activity, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> membrane permeability, or mitochondrial fitness. Furthermore, treating control and ΔSLC25A17 cells with dehydroepiandrosterone, a commonly used glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor affecting NADPH regeneration, revealed a kinetic disconnection between the peroxisomal and cytosolic glutathione pools. Additionally, these experiments underscored the impact of SLC25A17 loss on peroxisomal NADPH metabolism. The relevance of these findings is discussed in the context of the still ambiguous substrate specificity of SLC25A17 and the recent observation that the mammalian peroxisomal membrane is readily permeable to both GSH and GSSG.",2023,12,29
Piperine improves the quality of porcine oocytes by reducing oxidative stress.,"Oxidative stress caused by light and high temperature arises during in vitro maturation (IVM), resulting in low-quality embryos compared with those obtained in vivo. To overcome this problem, we investigated the influence of piperine (PIP) treatment during maturation of porcine oocytes on subsequent embryo development in vitro. Porcine oocytes were cultured in IVM medium supplemented with 0, 50, 100, 200, or 400 μM PIP. After parthenogenetic activation, the blastocyst (BL) formation was significantly higher and the apoptosis rate was significantly lower using 200 μM PIP-treated oocytes (200 PIP). In the 200 PIP group, the level of reactive oxygen species at the metaphase II stage was decreased, accompanied by an increased level of glutathione and increased expression of antioxidant processes (Nrf2, CAT, HO-1, SOD1, and SOD2). Consistently, chromosome misalignment and aberrant spindle organization were alleviated and phosphorylated p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was increased in the 200 PIP group. Expression of development-related (CDX2, NANOG, POU5F1, and SOX2), anti-apoptotic (BCL2L1 and BIRC5), and pro-apoptotic (BAK, FAS, and CASP3) processes was altered in the 200 PIP group. Ultimately, embryo development was improved in the 200 PIP group following somatic cell nuclear transfer. These findings suggest that PIP improves the quality of porcine oocytes by reducing oxidative stress, which inevitably arises via IVM. In-depth mechanistic studies of porcine oocytes will improve the efficiencies of assisted reproductive technologies.",2023,12,28
Hepatic GRK2 is dispensable for glucose homeostasis and other key metabolic parameters in mice.,"G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) abrogate GPCR signaling by promoting receptor desensitization and internalization. Accumulating evidence suggests that GRK2 represents an important regulator of GPCR-mediated effects on systemic glucose metabolism, obesity, and insulin resistance. Despite the key role of the liver in maintaining euglycemia, the potential metabolic relevance of hepatic GRK2 has yet to be examined. Thus, the goal of this study was to explore the potential role of hepatic GRK2 in maintaining glucose homeostasis and other key metabolic functions.",2023,12,28
Competitive inhibition of nicotine acetylcholine receptors using microneedles of nicotine and varenicline for smoking withdrawal therapy.,"Current strategies for smoking withdrawal conditions involve monotherapy of nicotine and combinational therapy of nicotine with varenicline or bupropion as per the CDC and FDA. The available dosage forms for nicotine are patches, gums, inhalers and nasal sprays, bupropion and varenicline are available in tablet form. This research work focused on developing a microneedle delivery system to deliver combination drug for overcoming the obstacles encountered by oral route of administration of varenicline such as severe side effects (mood swings, agitation, depressed behaviour, seizures, etc), and nicotine therapy challenges such as short half-life, repeated dosing, nausea, and vomiting. The nanoparticles of nicotine prepared by nanoprecipitation method showed particle size PTZ (356.6 ± 65.98), percentage entrapment efficiency (35.55 % ± 0.007), in-vitro drug release (47.89 % ± 0.7) for 72 h. Microneedles showed height (600 μm), width (350 μm), and tip diameter (10 μm). The nanoparticles encapsulated in microneedles showed in-vitro sustained delivery of nicotine (67.00 % ± 4.92) and varenicline (79.78 % ± 1.09) in 48 h. Nicotine released in a sustained manner attaches to the nicotine acetylcholine receptors (nAchR) to release dopamine for controlling the withdrawal challenges such as anxiety, irritability, cravings, disturbed sleep pattern, etc. The varenicline released from microneedles binds to the nAchR and inhibits dopamine release responsible for the euphoric effect induced by nicotine, and thus assists in curbing the nicotine withdrawal symptoms. This combination microneedle system offers prolonged treatment in a single application for smoking withdrawal conditions wherein patients are not in stage of oral dosing because of repeated dosing resulting in adverse effects like seizures, hypertension, sleep disturbances, insomnia, and nausea.",2023,12,28
"Causes, Symptoms, and Treatments of Nerve Entrapments Around the Elbow: Current Concepts.","The elbow is a joint extremely susceptible to stiffness, even after a trivial trauma. As for other joints, several factors can generate stiffness such as immobilization, joint incongruity, heterotopic ossification, adhesions or pain. Prolonged joint immobilization, pursued to assure bony and ligamentous healing, represents the most acknowledged risk factor for joint stiffness. The elbow is a common site of nerve entrapment syndromes. The reasons are multifactorial but peculiar elbow anatomy and biomechanics play a role. Passing from the arm into the forearm, the ulnar, median, and radial nerves run at the elbow in close rapport with the joint, fibrous arches and through narrow fibro-osseous tunnel. The elbow joint, in fact, has a large range of flexion which expose nerves lying posterior to the axis of rotation to traction and those anterior to compression.",2023,12,28
New insight into the agonism of protease-activated receptors as an immunotherapeutic strategy.,"The activation and mobilization of immune cells play a crucial role in immunotherapy. Existing therapeutic interventions, such as cytokines administration, aim to enhance immune cell activity. However, these approaches usually result in modest effectiveness and toxic side effects, thereby restricting their clinical application. Protease-activated receptors (PARs), a subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), actively participate in the immune system by directly activating immune cells. The activation of PARs by proteases or synthetic ligands can modulate immune cell behavior, signalling, and responses to treat immune-related diseases, suggesting the significance of PARs agonism in immunotherapy. However, the agonism of PARs in therapeutical applications remains rarely discussed, since it has been traditionally considered that PARs activation facilitates disease progressions. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the activation, rather than inhibition, of PARs in immune-related physiological responses and diseases. Additionally, we will discuss the emerging immunotherapeutic potential of PARs agonism, providing a new strategic direction for PARs-mediated immunotherapy.",2023,12,28
A versatile in situ cofactor enhancing system for meeting cellular demands for engineered metabolic pathways.,"Cofactor imbalance obstructs the productivities of metabolically engineered cells. Herein, we employed a minimally perturbing system, xylose reductase and lactose (XR/lactose), to increase levels of a pool of sugar-phosphates which are connected to the biosynthesis of NAD(P)H, FAD, FMN and ATP in Escherichia coli. The XR/lactose system could increase the amounts of the precursors of these cofactors and was tested with three different metabolically engineered cell systems (fatty alcohol biosynthesis, bioluminescence light generation and alkane biosynthesis) with different cofactor demands. Productivities of these cells were increased 2-4-fold by the XR/lactose system. Untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed different metabolite patterns among these cells; demonstrating that only metabolites involved in relevant cofactor biosynthesis were altered. The results were also confirmed by transcriptomic analysis. Another sugar reducing system (glucose dehydrogenase, GDH) could also be used to increase fatty alcohol production but resulted in less yield enhancement than XR. This work demonstrates that the approach of increasing cellular sugar phosphates can be a generic tool to increase in vivo cofactor generation upon cellular demand for synthetic biology.",2023,12,28
"Regulation of protein O-GlcNAcylation by circadian, metabolic, and cellular signals.","O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation) is a dynamic post-translational modification that regulates thousands of proteins and almost all cellular processes. Aberrant O-GlcNAcylation has been associated with numerous diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes. O-GlcNAcylation is highly nutrient sensitive since it is dependent on UDP-GlcNAc, the end product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). We previously observed daily rhythmicity of protein O-GlcNAcylation in a Drosophila model that is sensitive to timing of food consumption. We showed that the circadian clock plays a key role in regulating daily O-GlcNAcylation rhythms given its control of feeding-fasting cycle and hence nutrient availability. Interestingly, we reported that the circadian clock also modulates daily O-GlcNAcylation rhythm by regulating molecular mechanisms beyond the regulation of food consumption time. A large body of work now indicates that O-GlcNAcylation is likely a generalized cellular status effector as it responds to various cellular signals and conditions, such as ER stress, apoptosis, and infection. In this review, we summarize the metabolic regulation of protein O-GlcNAcylation through nutrient availability, HBP enzymes and O-GlcNAc processing enzymes. We discuss the emerging roles of circadian clocks in regulating daily O-GlcNAcylation rhythm. Finally, we provide an overview of other cellular signals or conditions that impact O-GlcNAcylation. Many of these cellular pathways are themselves regulated by the clock and/or metabolism. Our review highlights the importance of maintaining optimal O-GlcNAc rhythm by restricting eating activity to the active period under physiological conditions and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets of O-GlcNAc homeostasis under pathological conditions.",2023,12,28
The YBX3 RNA-binding protein post-transcriptionally controls SLC1A5 mRNA in proliferating and differentiating skeletal muscle cells.,"In humans, skeletal muscles comprise nearly 40% of total body mass, which is maintained throughout adulthood by a balance of muscle protein synthesis and breakdown. Cellular amino acid (AA) levels are critical for these processes, and mammalian cells contain transporter proteins that import AAs to maintain homeostasis. Until recently, the control of transporter regulation has largely been studied at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. However, here we report that the RNA-binding protein YBX3 is critical to sustain intracellular AAs in mouse skeletal muscle cells, which aligns with our recent findings in human cells. We find that YBX3 directly binds the SLC1A5 AA transporter messenger (m)RNA to post-transcriptionally control SLC1A5 expression during skeletal muscle cell differentiation. YBX3 regulation of SLC1A5 requires the 3' untranslated region (UTR). Additionally, intracellular AAs transported by SLC1A5, either directly or indirectly through coupling to other transporters, are specifically reduced when YBX3 is depleted. Further, we find that reduction of the YBX3 protein reduces proliferation and impairs differentiation in skeletal muscle cells, and that YBX3 and SLC1A5 protein expression increase substantially during skeletal muscle differentiation, independently of their respective mRNA levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that YBX3 regulates AA transport in skeletal muscle cells and that its expression is critical to maintain skeletal muscle cell proliferation and differentiation.",2023,12,28
A peptidoglycan N-deacetylase specific for anhydroMurNAc chain termini in Agrobacterium tumefaciens.,"During growth, bacteria remodel and recycle their peptidoglycan. A key family of peptidoglycan degrading enzymes is the lytic transglycosylases, which produce anhydromuropeptides, a modification that caps the peptidoglycan chains and contributes to bacterial virulence. Previously it was reported that the polar-growing Gram-negative plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens lacks anhydromuropeptides. Here, we report the identification of an enzyme, MdaA, which specifically removes the acetyl group from anhydromuropeptide chain termini in A. tumefaciens, resolving this apparent anomaly. A. tumefaciens lacking MdaA accumulates canonical anhydromuropeptides, while MdaA was able to deacetylate anhydro-N-acetyl muramic acid in purified sacculi that lack this modification. As for other peptidoglycan deacetylases, MdaA belongs to the CE4 family of carbohydrate esterases but harbors an unusual Cys residue in its active site. MdaA is conserved in other polar-growing bacteria, suggesting a possible link between peptidoglycan chain terminus deacetylation and polar growth.",2023,12,28
Paxillin family proteins Hic-5 and LPXN promote lipid storage by regulating the ubiquitination degradation of CIDEC.,"Many metabolic diseases are caused by disorders of lipid homeostasis. CIDEC, a lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein, plays a critical role in controlling LD fusion and lipid storage. However, regulators of CIDEC remain largely unknown. Here, we established a homogeneous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF)-based high-throughput screening method and identified LPXN as a positive regulatory candidate for CIDEC. LPXN and Hic-5, the members of Paxillin family, are focal adhesion adaptor proteins that contribute to the recruitment of specific kinases and phosphatases, cofactors, and structural proteins, participating in the transduction of extracellular signals into intracellular responses. Our data showed that Hic-5 and LPXN significantly increased the protein level of CIDEC and enhanced CIDEC stability not through TAG synthesis and FAK signaling pathways. Hic-5 and LPXN reduced the ubiquitination of CIDEC and inhibited its proteasome degradation pathway. Furthermore, Hic-5 and LPXN enlarged lipid droplets and promoted lipid storage in adipocytes. Therefore, we identified Hic-5 and LPXN as novel regulators of CIDEC. Our current findings also suggest intervention with Hic-5 and LPXN might ameliorate ectopic fat storage by enhancing the lipid storage capacity of white adipose tissues.",2023,12,28
Topical and IL therapies for hidradenitis suppurativa: A systematic literature review.,"Topical and intralesional (IL) treatments may be considered the first-line therapy in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS); however, the evidence supporting their use is limited.

"Amphotericin B loaded nanoemulsion: Optimization, characterization and in-vitro activity against L. donovani promastigotes.","The present work aimed to develop and evaluate AmB-loaded nano-emulsion (AmB-NE) which will augment the solubility of AmB and lead to enhanced anti-leishmanial activity. The composition of AmB-NE was optimized by systematic screening followed by DoE-extreme vertices mixture design. The optimized NE revealed mean droplet size and PDI of 44.19 ± 5.5 nm, 0.265 ± 0.0723, respectively. The NE could efficiently encapsulate AmB with drug content and efficiency 83.509 ± 0.369% and 81.659 ± 0.013%, respectively. The presence of cholesterol and stearyl amine retarded the release (P < 0.0001) of AmB significantly compared to AmB suspension. The AmB-NE and pure AmB suspension demonstrated the IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.06309 μg/mL and 0.3309 μg/mL against L.donovani promastigotes after 48 h incubation. The formulation was robust at all exaggerated stability conditions such as freeze-thaw and centrifugation. These findings indicate that AmB-NE is an attractive approach to treat visceral leishmaniasis with improved activity.",2023,12,28
Gold nanoparticle-mediated photothermal therapy guidance with multi-wavelength photomagnetic imaging.,"Difficulty in heating tumors with high spatial selectivity while protecting surrounding healthy tissues from thermal harm is a challenge for cancer photothermal treatment (PTT). To mitigate this problem, PTT mediated by photothermal agents (PTAs) has been established as a potential therapeutic technique to boost selectivity and reduce damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Various gold nanoparticles (AuNP) have been effectively utilized as PTAs, mainly using strategies to target cancerous tissue and increase selective thermal damage. Meanwhile, imaging can be used in tandem to monitor the AuNP distribution and guide the PTT. Mainly, the parameters impacting the induced temperature can be determined using simulation tools before treatment for effective PTT. However, accurate simulations can only be performed if the amount of AuNPs accumulated in the tumor is known. This study introduces Photo-Magnetic Imaging (PMI), which can appropriately recover the AuNP concentration to guide the PTT. Using multi-wavelength measurements, PMI can provide AuNP concentration based on their distinct absorption spectra. Tissue-simulating phantom studies are conducted to demonstrate the potential of PMI in recovering AuNP concentration for PTT planning. The recovered AuNP concentration is used to model the temperature increase accurately in a small inclusion representing tumor using a multiphysics solver that takes into account the light propagation and heat diffusion in turbid media.",2023,12,28

Weight-reducing dietary intervention increases the ability of hyperinsulinemia to suppress serum ghrelin concentration in individuals with obesity.,"Ghrelin is an orexigenic peptide secreted mainly by the stomach. Serum ghrelin concentration are suppressed after a meal, probably due to insulin release. Individuals with obesity are characterized by a lower fasting serum ghrelin and a lower ghrelin decrease after a meal. The effect of weight loss on the ability of insulin to suppress serum ghrelin concentration remains unknown.",2023,12,28
Weight Loss Interventions for Adults with Obesity-Related Asthma.,"Obesity is a common asthma comorbidity in adults, contributing to higher patient morbidity and mortality. Conversely, weight loss can reduce the impact of obesity on asthma and improve patient outcomes by diverse mechanisms including modulating airway inflammation, reducing oxidative stress, and improving lung function. Multiple lifestyle, non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical interventions are effective at reducing weight in the general population. Fewer have been studied specifically in the context of patients with asthma. However, increasingly effective pharmacologic options for weight loss highlight the need for allergists and pulmonologists to understand the range of approaches that may directly or indirectly yield clinical benefits in asthma management. Weight loss interventions often require multi-disciplinary support to create strategies that can realistically achieve a patient's personalized asthma and weight goals. This includes minimizing the adverse weight effects of glucocorticoids which remain a mainstay of asthma management. Disparities in access, cost and insurance coverage of weight loss interventions remain acute challenges for providers and patients. Future studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms of action of specific weight loss interventions on short-term and long-term asthma outcomes.",2023,12,28
Cost analysis of next-generation imaging in high-risk prostate cancer staging.,"Next-generation imaging (NGI) tests, such as choline PET/CT and PSMA PET, have shown to increase sensitivity in the detection of nodal and metastatic disease in prostate cancer. However, their use implies an increase in diagnostic costs compared to conventional imaging (CI) tests such as CT and bone scan. The aim of our study was to determine which diagnostic pathway is more cost-effective in high-risk prostate cancer.",2023,12,29
The impact of degraded vision on emotional perception of audiovisual stimuli: An event-related potential study.,"Emotion recognition will be challenged for individuals when visual signals are degraded in real-life scenarios. Recently, researchers have conducted many studies on the distinct neural activity between clear and degraded audiovisual stimuli. These findings addressed the ""how"" question, but the precise stage of the distinct activity that occurred remains unknown. Therefore, it is crucial to use event-related potential (ERP) to explore the ""when"" question, just the time course of the neural activity of degraded audiovisual stimuli. In the present research, we established two conditions: clear auditory + degraded visual (AcVd) and clear auditory + clear visual (AcVc) multisensory conditions. We enlisted 31 participants to evaluate the emotional valence of audiovisual stimuli. The resulting data were analyzed using ERP in time domains and Microstate analysis. Current results suggest that degraded vision impairs the early-stage processing of audiovisual stimuli, with the superior parietal lobule (SPL) regulating audiovisual processing in a top-down fashion. Additionally, our findings indicate that negative and positive stimuli elicit greater EPN compared to neutral stimuli, pointing towards a subjective motivation-related attentional regulation. To sum up, in the early stage of emotional audiovisual processing, the degraded visual signal affected the perception of the physical attributes of audiovisual stimuli and had a further influence on emotion extraction processing, leading to the different regulation of top-down attention resources in the later stage.",2023,12,29
Monitoring the Photorhabdus spp. bacterial load in Heterorhabditis bacteriophora dauer juveniles over different storage times and temperatures: A molecular approach.,"Biological control products based on the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora can vary in virulence (quality). The influence of their symbiotic bacteria Photorhabdus spp. inside the infective dauer juvenile (DJ) on DJ quality has not received much attention in the past. The presence of the bacteria in the DJ is crucial for its biocontrol potential. This investigation provides a method to quantify the bacterial load inside the DJ based on a qPCR technique. Information from the genome of Photorhabdus laumondii strain DE2 was used to identify single copy genes with no homology to any other bacterial accessions. One gene (hereby named CG2) was selected for primers design and for further qPCR experiments. Cross-amplification tests with P. thracensis and P. kayaii, also symbionts of H. bacteriophora, were positive, whereas no amplicons were produced for P. temperata or Xenorhabdus nematophila. We tested our qPCR system in DJ populations carrying defined proportions of bacteria-free (axenic) vs bacteria-carrying nematodes. With an increasing proportion of axenic DJ in a population, virulence declined, and the virulence was proportional to the amount of bacterial DNA detected in the population by qPCR. Along liquid storage over long time, virulence also decreased, and this factor correlated with the reduction of bacterial DNA on the respective DJ population. We observed that stored DJ kept virulent up to 90 days and thereafter the virulence as well as the amount of bacterial DNA drastically decreased. Storage temperature also influenced the bacterial survival. Inside formulated DJ, the loss of bacterial DNA on the DJ population was accelerated under storage temperatures below 7.5 °C, suggesting that reproduction of the bacterial cells takes place when growth temperature is favorable. The role of bacterial survival inside stored DJ can now be adequately addressed using this molecular quality-control technique.",2023,12,28

This study developed a deep learning model, trained on a diverse dataset of esophageal cancer prescriptions, to improve dose prediction accuracy.",2023,12,28
Trophic transfer of rare earth elements in the food web of the Loire estuary (France).,"The increasing use of rare earth elements (REEs) in many industrial sectors and in medecine, causes discharges into the environment and particularly in estuarine areas subjected to strong anthropogenic pressures. Here, we assessed the distribution of REEs along the food web of the Loire estuary. Several species representative of different trophic levels were sampled: 8 vertebrates, 3 crustaceans, 2 mollusks, 3 annelids and 4 algae, as well as Haploops sp. tubes rather related to sediment. The total REE concentrations measured by ICP-MS were the highest in haploops tubes (141.1 ± 4.7 μg/g dw), algae (1.5 to 34.5 μg/g dw), mollusks (9.9 to 12.0 μg/g dw), annelids (0.7 to 19.9 μg/g dw) and crustaceans (1.4 to 6.3 μg/g dw) and the lowest in vetebrates (0.1 to 1.6 μg/g dw). The individual contribution of REEs was, however, similar between most studied species with a higher contribution of light REEs (76.7 ± 7.6 %) compared to heavy REEs (14.1 ± 3.7 %) or medium REEs (9.2 ± 5.8 %). Trophic relations were estimated by stable isotope analysis of C and N and the linear regression of δ15N with total REE concentrations highlighted a trophic dilution with a corresponding TMS of -2.0. The tissue-specific bioaccumulation investigated for vertebrates demonstrated a slightly higher REE accumulation in gonads than in the muscle. Finally, positive Eu, Gd, Tb and Lu anomalies were highlighted in the normalized REE patterns of most studied species (especially in fish and crustaceans) which is consistent with results in the dissolved phase for Eu and Gd. These anomalies could either be due to anthropogenic inputs or to various bioaccumulation/elimination processes according to the specific species physiology. This study, including most of the trophic levels of the Loire estuary food web provides new insights on the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of REEs in natural ecosystems.",2023,12,28
A reliable method to determine airborne microplastics using quantum cascade laser infrared spectrometry.,"The number of studies dealing with airborne microplastics (MPs) is increasing but sampling and sample treatment are not standardized, yet. Here, a fast and reliable method to characterize MPs is presented. It involves the study of two passive sampling devices to collect atmospheric bulk deposition (wet and dry deposition) and three digestion methods (two alkaline-oxidative and an oxidative) to treat the samples. The alkaline-oxidative method based on KOH and NaClO was selected for a mild organic matrix digestion. In addition, some operational parameters of a high-throughput quantum cascade laser-based infrared device (LDIR) were optimized: an effective automatic tiered approach to differentiate fibres from particles (>90 % success in validation) and a criterion to establish positive matches when comparing an unknown spectrum against the spectral database (proposed match index > 0.85). The procedural analytical recoveries were very good for particles (82-90 %) and slightly lower for fibres (62-73 %). Finally, the amount and type of MPs deposited at a sub-urban area NW Spain were evaluated. Most common polymers were Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP) and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The deposition rates ranged 98-1220 MP/m<sup>2</sup>/day, ca. 1.7 % of the total collected particles. More than 50 % of the total MPs deposited were in the 20-50 μm size range, whereas fibres were mostly in the 50-500 μm size range.",2023,12,28
"Parent and halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exposure in aluminum smelter workers: Serum levels, accumulation trends, and association with health indicators.","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their halogenated derivatives (HPAHs) can be unintentionally formed and released during industrial thermal processes. However, information on internal exposure and health risks of PAHs and HPAHs for thermal industry workers is very limited. In this study, serum samples from 220 aluminum smelter workers in East China were analyzed, and the relationship between the levels of these pollutants and various health indicators was also assessed. The workers had markedly higher serum concentrations of PAHs and HPAHs than the controls. The serum concentrations of ∑<sub>13</sub>PAHs and ∑<sub>9</sub>HPAHs increased with increasing age and occupational exposure duration in male workers. A positive correlation was observed between the ∑<sub>13</sub>PAH and ∑<sub>9</sub>HPAH serum concentrations, and the concentration of ∑<sub>13</sub>PAHs was approximately 50 times higher than that of ∑<sub>9</sub>HPAHs. For benzo[a]pyrene equivalent (BaP<sub>eq</sub>)-based risk assessment, the contribution of PAHs and HPAHs to the risk was 80 % and 20 % in the workers. PAHs and HPAHs showed a positive association with pulmonary hypofunction, hypertension and abnormal electrocardiogram. This study indicates occupational exposure to these toxic pollutants remains a significant issue and provides evidence that elevated serum levels of ∑<sub>13</sub>PAHs and ∑<sub>9</sub>HPAHs may be associated with an increased risk of lung and cardiovascular diseases.",2023,12,28
A comprehensive investigation to the fate of phosphorus in full-scale wastewater treatment plants using aluminum salts for enhanced phosphorus removal.,"This study investigated the fate of phosphorus (P) in 8 full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Shanghai, China, in which both biological nutrient removal and aluminum-based chemical phosphorus removal were used. The results showed that 83.8-98.9 % P was transferred to the sludge in the 8 WWTPs by both chemical and biological reactions. P speciation analysis indicated that chemical P precipitates accounted for 84.3 % in the activated sludge, of which crystalline AlPO<sub>4</sub> and amorphous iron‑phosphorus compounds (FePs) were the main components. Sludge with more water-soluble and weakly adsorbed P was generated in the anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A/A/O) process than in other processes. Among the 8 WWTPs, the one with the largest flow rate and relatively short sludge retention time (SRT) had the best potential to release P from all types of sludge. The recovery potential of P from thickened sludge can be improved by separately thickening the sludge produced in the high-efficiency sedimentation tank or feeding it into the dewatering process directly. Different P removal chemicals and dosing points changed the amount of chemical precipitate formed but had little effect on the composition of P accumulating organisms (PAOs) at the genus level. Although aluminum-based coagulants were applied in the investigated WWTPs, Fe in wastewater had the most positive effect on the proliferation of PAOs. The synthesis of polyphosphate was also related to the metabolism of PAOs as it affected transmembrane inorganic phosphate (Pi) transport and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis. The in-depth understanding of the fate of P is beneficial to improve P recovery efficiency in WWTPs.",2023,12,29
"Multiple stable isotopes and geochemical approaches to elucidate groundwater reactive transport paths in mining cities: A case from the northern Anhui, China.","Mining cities are ecotone areas where human and natural components interact. Indeed, the negative effects of mining activities on drinking water quality have become a serious public concern worldwide. To elucidate groundwater genesis and reactive transport path controlling the water pollution, a multi-bodies system in the Sunan Mine area in China was considered in this study. The results of the mineral phase characterizations, hydrochemical analysis, and multiple stable isotopes (δ<sup>2</sup>H/δ<sup>18</sup>O, δ<sup>34</sup>S and <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr) indicated that calcite, dolomite, gypsum, quartz, halite, organic carbon, and gases (O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O) were the primary reactants in the aquifer system, accompanied by dissolution and precipitation of minerals, cation exchange, desulfation, and evaporation. An inverse hydrogeochemical model was employed to identify three paths, Path 1 demonstrated that mine water mainly originated from the Quaternary loose aquifer water (QLA), Permian fractured sandstone aquifer water (PFA), and Carbonifer fractured limestone aquifer water (CFA), accompanied by high K<sup>+</sup>+Na<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations due to the carbonate dissolution, halite dissolution, and cation exchange processes. Path 2 showed that the recharge of the CFA and Ordovician fractured limestone aquifer (OFA) occurred from the shallow recharge zone to the deeper OFA water through faults and fractures, mainly involving halite dissolution, carbonate dissolution, and gypsum dissolution. Path 3 demonstrated the interaction between the Hui River, collapsed pond water, and QLA, accompanied by gypsum dissolution, calcite dissolution, and cation exchange. Although the shallow QLA quality met the WHO drinking water standards, the pollution risk from the surface collapse pit water cannot be ignored. Therefore, effective approaches need to be considered in the study area to reduce the connection between the collapse pit water and QLA. The study results can help decision makers to predict water quality of complex water systems in ecotone areas and other similar regions worldwide.",2023,12,28
Natural and anthropogenic controls on environmental change during the Holocene based on a multi-proxy record obtained from subalpine peatland in southern China.,"The interactions between past climate, human activity and environmental change in subtropical mountainous areas are poorly understood due to the lack of reliable records in South China. In this study, the evolution of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) during the Holocene, and the interactions between regional human activity and environmental change, were studied using multi-proxy records from a subalpine peat core recovered from South China. The chronology of this peat core has been well-constrained by 10 AMS <sup>14</sup>C dates of peat stems. A series of proxy indicators, including carbon isotopes (δ<sup>13</sup>C), loss on ignition (LOI), magnetic susceptibility (MS), the chemical index of alteration (CIA), and geochemical elements from the Shiwangutian (SWGT) peatland were used to reconstruct the palaeohydrological changes during the Holocene. Regional moisture levels showed a generally arid-wet-arid pattern, and three phases of climatic change were detected as follows. 1) Between 11,600 and 9000 cal yr BP, the EASM was weak and a relatively dry climate developed. 2) Between 9000 and 4000 cal yr BP, the prevalence of humid climatic conditions was associated with a strong summer monsoon. 3) After 4000 cal yr BP, the climate shifted to relatively dry conditions. Further comparisons and analysis suggested that solar insolation, migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity played an important role in determining the variations in Holocene EASM intensity. In addition, the increase in both MS and heavy metal concentrations over the last 1000 years is consistent with an increase in the population of Hunan Province. Therefore, it can be inferred that population growth and the associated expansion of cropland and mining led to an increase in soil erosion and metal tool use. These findings suggest that the impact of human activity generally outweighed the natural climatic controls on the environment and landscape in the mountainous region of southern China over the last 1000 years.",2023,12,28
Flocculation under combined effects of hydrodynamic and subaqueous biomass in the bottom boundary layer (BBL) of a microtidal estuary.,"The flocculation dynamics within the bottom boundary layer (BBL) of tidal estuaries constitute a pivotal and intricate aspect entwined with hydrodynamics and morphodynamics. In microtidal estuaries, where saltwater intrusion occurs, the ensuing impacts on ecosystems, biological habitats, and human activities underscore necessity for comprehensive understanding. In pursuit of elucidating flocculation dynamics within estuarine BBLs, an extensive 25-hour survey was conducted throughout a complete tidal-cycle in the Huangmaohai estuary, China. This investigation encompassed the collection of data pertaining hydrodynamics, biochemical characteristics of suspended flocs within the BBL. The observed irregular semidiurnal tide was delineated into six distinct stages: I) Weak flood, II) Flood slack, III) Strong ebb, IV) Ebb slack, V) Strong flood and VI) Flood slack. The amalgamation of empirical findings and theoretical analyses has facilitated the development of conceptual model delineating the intricate processes and interactions of multiple factors within each stage (I-VI) in the BBL of a prototypical micro-tidal estuary. Notably, it reveals biological factors exhibit a significantly higher efficacy in estuarine flocculation dynamics within the BBL compared to the chemical ion attractions, attributable to variations in salinity. Further nuances emerged, indicating that semi-liquid extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) plays a substantial role in the formation of high-density flocs, particularly during periods of heightened turbulent shear conditions in flood and ebb times (I, III, V). Conversely, particulate biological debris predominantly contributes to low-density flocs characterized by a low settling velocity, particularly for large flocs >200 μm during tidal slacks (I, IV), and smaller median-sized flocs (70-200 μm) during flood or ebb times (III, V) due to turbulent induced breakage of bio-particles. This study underscores the significance of quantitative investigations into the biological components within individual flocs under estuarine hydrodynamics as a pivotal step towards comprehending flocculation mechanisms and predicting cohesive sediment transport within the BBLs of estuaries.",2023,12,28
Gut microbiota disorders aggravate terbuthylazine-induced mitochondrial quality control disturbance and PANoptosis in chicken hepatocyte through gut-liver axis.,"Terbuthylazine (TBA) is a widely prevalent pesticide pollutant, which is a global concern due to its environmental residual. However, the toxic mechanism of TBA have not been fully solved. Here, we explored that TBA exposure disrupts the intestinal flora and aggravated disturbance of mitochondrial quality control and PANapoptosis in hepatocytes via gut-liver axis. Our findings demonstrated that TBA exposure induced significant damage to the jejunum barrier, evidenced by a marked decrease in the expression of Occludin and ZO-1. Moreover. TBA led to intestinal microflora disorder, manifested as the decreased abundance of Firmicutes, and increased abundance of the Nitrospirota, Chloroflexi, Desulfobacterota, Crenarchaeota, Myxococcota, and Planctomycetota. Meanwhile, intestinal microflora disorder affected the biological processes of lipid metabolism and cell growth and death of hepatocytes by RNA-Seq analysis. Furthermore, TBA could induced mitochondrial quality control imbalance, including mitochondrial redox disorders, lower activity of mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis decrease, and increasing level of mitophagy. Subsequently, TBA significantly increased expression levels of pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis-related proteins. In general, these results demonstrated the underlying mechanisms of TBA-induced hepatotoxicity induced via the gut-liver axis, which provides a theoretical basis for further research of ecotoxicology of TBA.",2023,12,29
Weakened casual feedback loops following intensive restoration efforts and climate changes in a large shallow freshwater lake.,"Understanding how phytoplankton interacts with local and regional drivers as well as their feedbacks is a great challenge, and quantitative analyses of the regulating role of human activities and climate changes on these feedback loops are also limited. By using monthly monitoring dataset (2000-2017) from Lake Taihu and empirical dynamic modelling to construct causal networks, we quantified the strengths of causal feedbacks among phytoplankton, local environments, zooplankton, meteorology as well as global climate oscillation. Prevalent bidirectional causal linkages between phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) and the tested drivers were found, providing holistic and quantitative evidence of the ubiquitous feedback loops. Phytoplankton biomass exhibited the highest feedbacks with total inorganic nitrogen and ammonia and the lowest with nitrate. The feedbacks between phytoplankton biomass and environmental factors from 2000 to 2017 could be classified into two groups: the local environments (e.g., nutrients, pH, transparency, zooplankton biomass)-driven enhancement loops promoting the response of the phytoplankton biomass, and the climate (e.g., wind speed)-driven regulatory loops suppressing it. The two counterbalanced groups modified the emergent macroecological patterns. Our findings revealed that the causal feedback networks loosened significantly after 2007 following nutrient loading reduction and unsuccessful biomanipulation restoration attempts by stocking carp. The strength of enhancement loops underwent marked decreases leading to reduced phytoplankton responses to the tested drivers, while the climate (decreasing wind speed, warming winter)-driven regulatory loops increased- like a tug-of-war. To counteract the self-amplifying feedback loops, the present eutrophication mitigation efforts, especially nutrient reduction, should be continued, and introduction of alternative measures to indirectly regulate the critical components (e.g., pH, Secchi depth, zooplankton biomass) of the loops would be beneficial.",2023,12,28
"Insight into microplastics in the aquatic ecosystem: Properties, sources, threats and mitigation strategies.","Globally recognized as emergent contaminants, microplastics (MPs) are prevalent in aquaculture habitats and subject to intense management. Aquaculture systems are at risk of microplastic contamination due to various channels, which worsens the worldwide microplastic pollution problem. Organic contaminants in the environment can be absorbed by and interact with microplastic, increasing their toxicity and making treatment more challenging. There are two primary sources of microplastics: (1) the direct release of primary microplastics and (2) the fragmentation of plastic materials resulting in secondary microplastics. Freshwater, atmospheric and marine environments are also responsible for the successful migration of microplastics. Until now, microplastic pollution and its effects on aquaculture habitats remain insufficient. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the impact of microplastics on aquatic ecosystems. It highlights the sources and distribution of microplastics, their physical and chemical properties, and the potential ecological consequences they pose to marine and freshwater environments. The paper also examines the current scientific knowledge on the mechanisms by which microplastics affect aquatic organisms and ecosystems. By synthesizing existing research, this review underscores the urgent need for effective mitigation strategies and further investigation to safeguard the health and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems.",2023,12,28
Impact of climate change on snowpack dynamics in coastal Central-Western Greenland.,"Snow patterns in ice-free areas of Greenland play important roles in ecosystems. Within a changing climate, a comprehensive understanding of the snow responses to climate change is of interest to anticipate forthcoming dynamics in these areas. In this study, we analyze the future snowpack evolution of a polar maritime Arctic location, Qeqertarsuaq (Disko Island, Central-Western Greenland). A physically-based snow model (FSM2) is validated and forced with CMIP6 projections for SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 greenhouse gasses emission scenarios, using two models: CanESM5 and MIROC6. The future snowpack evolution is assessed through four key seasonal (October to May) snow climate indicators: snow depth, snow days, snowfall fraction and ablation rate. Comparison against the observed air temperature for the reference climate period demonstrates superior accuracies for MIROC6 SSP2.4-5, with anomalies at 19 %, compared to CanESM5 SSP5.8-5 (25 %) and CanESM5 SSP2.4-5 (78 %). In terms of precipitation, CanESM5 SSP2.4-5 and SSP2.4-5 exhibit smaller anomalies against the observed data (5 %) in contrast to MIROC6 SSP2.4-5 (15 %) and MIROC6 SSP2.8-5 (17 %). Results demonstrate distinct snowpack responses to climate change depending on the model and emission scenario. For CanESM5, seasonal snow depth anomalies with respect to the reference period range from - 38 % (SSP2-4.5, 2040-2050 period) to - 74 % (SSP5-8.5, 2090-2100 period). MIROC6 projects lower snowpack reductions, with a decrease ranging from - 38 % (SSP2-4.5, 2040-2050 period) to - 57 % (SSP5-8.5, 2090-2100 period). Similar reductions are anticipated for snowfall and snow days. Changes in the snowpack evolution are primarily driven by positive trends in downwelling longwave radiation and air temperature. The projected increase in precipitation by the mid to late 21st century will lead to more frequent rain-on-snow events, intensifying snowpack melting. These findings help enhance the comprehension of future snow dynamics in the ice-free zones of Greenland, as well as the associated hydrological and ecological changes.",2023,12,28
Proposal of a new empirical model with flow velocity to improve time-weighted average concentration estimates from the Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers.,"It is now widely recognized that the sampling rate of Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Samplers (POCIS) is significantly affected by flow velocity, which can cause a consequent bias when determining time-weighted average concentrations (TWAC). We already observed the desorption of deisopropylatrazine (DIA) over time when added to the receiving phase of a POCIS. This desorption rate was particularly influenced by flow velocity, in an agitated water environment in situ. In the method presented here, we calibrated 30 pesticides under controlled laboratory conditions, varying the flow velocity over four levels. We simultaneously studied the desorption rate of DIA-d5 (a deuterated form of DIA) over time. An empirical model based on a power law involving flow velocity was used to process the information from the accumulation kinetics of the compounds of interest and elimination of DIA-d5. This type of model makes it possible to consider the effect of this crucial factor on exchange kinetics, and then to obtain more accurate TWACs with reduced bias and more acceptable dispersion of results.",2023,12,28
"Microplastics in soils: Production, behavior process, impact on soil organisms, and related toxicity mechanisms.","In recent years, microplastics (MPs) pollution has become a hot ecological issue of global concern and MP pollution in soil is becoming increasingly serious. Studies have shown that MPs have adverse effects on soil biology and ecological functions. Although MPs are evident in soils, identifying their source, abundance, and types is difficult because of the complexity and variability of soil components. In addition, the effects of MPs on soil physicochemical properties (PCP), including direct effects such as direct interaction with soil particles and indirect effects such as the impact on soil organisms, have not been reported in a differentiated manner. Furthermore, at present, the soil ecological effects of MPs are mostly based on biological toxicity reports of their exudate or size effects, whereas the impact of their surface-specific properties (such as environmentally persistent free radicals, surface functional groups, charge, and curvature) on soil ecological functions is not fully understood. Considering this, this paper reviews the latest research findings on the production and behavioral processes of MPs in soil, the effects on soil PCP, the impacts on different soil organisms, and the related toxic mechanisms. The above discussion will enhance further understanding of the behavioral characteristics and risks of MPs in soil ecosystems and provide some theoretical basis for further clarification of the molecular mechanisms of the effects of MPs on soil organisms.",2023,12,28
"Principles, applications, and limitations of diffusive gradients in thin films induced fluxed in soils and sediments.","The diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique serves as a passive sampling method, inducing analyte transport and concentration. Its application is widespread in assessing labile components of metals, organic matter, and nutrients across various environmental media such as water, sediments, and saturated soils. The DGT devices effectively reduce the porewater concentration through irreversible binding of solutes, consequently promoting the release of labile species from the soil/sediment solid phase. However, the precise quantification of simultaneous adsorption and desorption of labile species using DGT devices alone remains a challenge. To address this challenge, the DGT-Induced Fluxes in Soils and Sediments (DIFS) model was developed. This model simulates analyte kinetics in solid phases, solutions, and binding resins by incorporating factors such as soil properties, resupply parameters, and kinetic principles. While the DIFS model has been iteratively improved to increase its accuracy in portraying kinetic behavior in soil/sediment, researchers' incomplete comprehension of it still results in unrealistic fitting outcomes and an oversight of the profound implications posed by kinetic parameters during implementation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the optimization and utilization of DIFS models, encompassing fundamental concepts behind DGT devices and DIFS models, the kinetic interpretation of DIFS parameters, and instances where the model has been applied to study soils and sediments. It also highlights preexisting limitations of the DIFS model and offers suggestions for more precise modeling in real-world environments.",2023,12,28
Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 Activation in Macrophages Contributes to Persistent Lung Inflammation following Respiratory Tract Viral Infection.,"Respiratory tract virus infections cause millions of hospitalizations worldwide each year. Severe infections lead to lung damage that coincides with persistent inflammation and a lengthy repair period. Vaccination and antiviral therapy help to mitigate severe infections before or during the acute stage of disease, but there are currently limited specific treatment options available to individuals experiencing the long-term sequelae of respiratory viral infection. C57BL/6 mice were infected with influenza A/PR/8/34 as a model for severe viral lung infection and allowed to recover for 21 days. Mice were treated with rapamycin, a well-characterized mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor, on days 12 to 20 after infection, a time period after viral clearance. Persistent inflammation following severe influenza infection in mice was primarily driven by macrophages and T cells. Uniform manifold approximation and projection analysis of flow cytometry data revealed that lung macrophages had high activation of mTORC1, an energy-sensing kinase involved in inflammatory immune cell effector functions. Rapamycin treatment reduced lung inflammation and the frequency of exudate macrophages, T cells, and B cells in the lung, while not impacting epithelial progenitor cells or adaptive immune memory. These data highlight mTORC1's role in sustaining persistent inflammation following clearance of a viral respiratory pathogen and suggest a possible intervention for post-viral chronic lung inflammation.",2023,12,28
Revascularization and Digestive Tract Repair in Secondary Aortoenteric Fistula Using a Single-center In situ Revascularization Strategy.,"Information regarding optimal revascularization and digestive tract repair in secondary aortoenteric fistula (sAEF) remains unclear.

Microsatellite markers for genotyping of Kodamaea ohmeri: Demonstrating outbreaks based on a multicenter surveillance study in China.,"Kodamaea ohmeri, an emerging human pathogen, caused both sporadic and nosocomial infections among immunocompromised people with high mortality. However, there is limited research on the molecular epidemiology of K. ohmeri. A total of fifty microsatellite loci were designed based on K. ohmeri type strain NRRL Y-1932 and three loci were finally selected for microsatellite analysis. Non-duplicated K. ohmeri isolates and strains of other species were collected across China as a part of CHIF-NET program for sensitivity and specificity verification. Antifungal susceptibility was determined using Sensititre YeastOne TM YO10. The three loci (P10, P11 and P26), with a cumulative discriminatory power of 0.98, exhibited a prospective specificity and reproducibility in the PCR of 92 K. ohmeri strains from different hospitals. A total of 54 microsatellite types (MT) were identified and most of them distributed sporadically. However, six strains of MT12 clustered in HZ hospital and were isolated in the same department within two months, indicating a potential outbreak. Of seven isolates exhibited MIC values of >8 mg/L for fluconazole, three isolates from LR hospital shared the same genotype of MT44. Herein, we established a set of microsatellite loci for K. ohmeri, as a rapid and specific tool for genotyping K. ohmeri, and identified several potential clusters. This study will help us better understand the molecular epidemiology of the emerging pathogen K. ohmeri.",2023,12,29
"Exploring the experiences and perceptions of coaches, athletes, and integrated support teams towards the management of three national Paralympic teams.","This study explored the experiences and perceptions of coaches, athletes, and integrated support teams towards the management of three Paralympic teams across North America and Europe. Six focus groups with athletes, three interviews with head coaches, and 10 interviews with support team members were conducted and analyzed using a reflexive thematic analysis. Our analysis resulted in three overarching themes to portray the coaches' role and behaviours in managing their (1) athletes, (2) integrated support teams, and (3) team as a collective unit. All teams were made up of a diverse group of athletes that required individualized considerations regarding age, finances, and disability. Coaches were successful when they fostered autonomy and managed interpersonal conflict by utilizing their integrated support teams to foster cohesiveness. This study provides an in-depth view of the role of the coach in managing national parasport teams by incorporating multiple perspectives from three teams around the world.",2023,12,28
Chitosan and its amphiphilic derivative nanoparticles loaded with Minoxidil for induction of hair growth: In vitro and in vivo evaluation.,"Minoxidil is widely used for treating Androgenic Alopecia, but its low hydrophilicity promotes the use of co-solvents in commercial formulations, which could then cause skin irritations. Nano-drug delivery systems have been developed to improve the solubility of lipophilic molecules and increase the concentration of drugs in hair follicles, thereby minimizing side effects. Chitosan (CS) and Methylated Aminobenzyl Carboxymethyl Chitosan (MCS) nanoparticles containing Minoxidil were prepared and evaluated for their physicochemical properties, drug release profile, skin permeation, cytotoxicity, and animal hair growth. The results showed that MCS nanoparticles had a 60 % drug release compared to CS nanoparticles, with almost complete release in 2 h. MCS nanoparticles also showed a 20 % drug permeation from skin compared to 70 % for CS nanoparticles in 24 h. In 48 and 72 h, CS and MCS nanoparticles didn't exhibit any significant cytotoxicity. Animal study revealed a significant increase in hair growth from MCS nanoparticles compared to the commercial formulation in fourteen days. However, MCS nanoparticles were less efficient compared to CS nanoparticles. The use of MCS in nano-drug delivery systems is expected to continue to gain importance due to its ability to enhance the solubility of hydrophobic drugs, particularly in the treatment of skin diseases.",2023,12,29
Identification and characterization of both cis- and trans-regulators mediating fenvalerate-induced expression of CYP6B7 in Helicoverpa armigera.,"As we known, inducibility is an important feature of P450 genes. Previous studies indicated that CYP6B7 could be induced and involved in fenvalerate detoxification in Helicoverpa armigera. However, the regulatory mechanism of CYP6B7 induced by fenvalerate is still unclear. In this study, CYP6B7 promoter of H. armigera was cloned and the cis-acting element of fenvalerate was identified to be located between -84 and - 55 bp of CYP6B7 promoter. Subsequently, 33 candidate transcription factors (CYP6B7-fenvalerate association proteins, CAPs) that may bind to the cis-acting element were screened and verified by yeast one-hybrid. Among them, the expression levels of several CAPs were significantly induced by fenvalerate. Knockdown of juvenile hormone-binding protein-like (JHBP), RNA polymerase II-associated protein 3 (RPAP3), fatty acid synthase-like (FAS) and peptidoglycan recognition protein LB-like (PGRP) resulted in significant expression inhibition of CYP6B7, and increased sensitivity of H. armigera to fenvalerate. Co-transfection of reporter gene p (-84/-55) with pFast-CAP showed that JHBP, RPAP3 and PGRP could significantly increase the activity of CYP6B7 promoter. These results suggested that trans-acting factors JHBP, RPAP3 and PGRP may bind with cis-acting elements to regulate the expression of CYP6B7 induced by fenvalerate, and play an important role in the detoxification of H. armigera to fenvalerate.",2023,12,28
MdbHLH93 confers drought tolerance by activating MdTyDC expression and promoting dopamine biosynthesis.,"Dopamine and its biosynthesis-limiting enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase (TyDC) play a vital part in mediating plant growth and the response to drought stress. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, drought stress markedly induced the expression of Malus domestica bHLH93 (MdbHLH93), the apple basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. Moreover, MdbHLH93 directly bound to the Malus domestica TyDC (MdTyDC) promoter and positively regulated its expression, which resulted in dopamine synthesis and enhanced drought tolerance. Furthermore, the additive effect of overexpressing MdbHLH93 and MdTyDC simultaneously promoted dopamine synthesis and drought tolerance in apples, while the interference of MdbHLH93 inhibited this effect, indicating that MdTyDC-regulated dopamine synthesis and drought tolerance were positively regulated by MdbHLH93. Taken together, these findings suggest the positive regulation of dopamine accumulation by MdbHLH93 through its transcriptional regulation of MdTyDC and show that increased dopamine content confers drought tolerance in apples.",2023,12,28
Cancer sensitizing effect of deazaflavin analogs is associated with increased intracellular drug accumulation.,"As part of our efforts geared towards developing mechanism-based cancer sensitizing agents, we have previously synthesized and characterized novel deazaflavin analogs as potent tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) inhibitors for combination treatments with topoisomerase II (TOP2) poisons. Interestingly, the sensitizing effect of a few analogs toward TOP2 poison etoposide (ETP) was associated with a significant increase in intracellular drug accumulation, which could be an alternative mechanism to boost the clinical efficacy of ETP in cancer chemotherapies. Hence, we evaluated more deazaflavin TDP2 inhibitors for their impact on drug retention in cancer cells. We found that all but one tested TDP2 inhibitors substantially increased the ETP retention in DT40 cells. Particularly, we identified an exceptionally potent analog, ZW-1226, which at 3 nM increased the intracellular ETP by 13-fold. Significantly, ZW-1226 also stimulated cellular accumulation of two other anticancer drugs, TOP2 poison teniposide and antifolate pemetrexed, and produced an effect more pronounced than those of ABC transporter inhibitors verapamil and elacridar in human leukemic CCRF-CEM cells toward ETP. Lastly, ZW-1226 potentiated the action of ETP in the sensitive human CCRF-CEM cells and a few resistant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, including H460 and H838 cells. Collectively, the results of this study strongly suggest that deazaflavin analog ZW-1226 could be an effective cancer sensitizing agent which warrants further investigation.",2023,12,29
Findings from the KNOW-CKD Study indicates that higher systolic blood pressure time in target range is associated with a lower risk of chronic kidney disease progression.,"Time-in-target range (TTR) of systolic blood pressure (SBP) is determined by the proportion of time during which SBP remains within a defined optimal range. TTR has emerged as a useful metric for assessing SBP control over time. However, it is uncertain if SBP-TTR can predict the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here, we investigated the association between SBP-TTR during the first year of enrollment and CKD progression among 1758 participants from the KNOW-CKD (KoreaN Cohort Study for Outcomes in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease). Baseline median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 51.7 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Participants were categorized into four SBP-TTR groups (0%, 1-50%, 51-99%, and 100%). The primary outcome was CKD progression defined as 50% or more decline in eGFR from baseline measurement or the initiation of kidney replacement therapy. During the follow-up period (9212 person-years over a median 5.4 years), the composite outcome occurred in 710 participants. In the multivariate cause-specific hazard model, a one-standard deviation increase in SBP-TTR was associated with an 11% lower risk of the composite outcome with hazard ratio, 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.97). Additionally, compared to patients with SBP-TTR 0%, the respective hazard ratios for those with SBP-TTR 1-50%, 51-99%, and 100% were 0.85 (0.68-1.07), 0.76 (0.60-0.96), and 0.72 (0.55-0.94), and the respective corresponding slopes of eGFR decline were -3.17 (-3.66 to -2.69), -3.02 (-3.35 to -2.68), -2.62 (-2.89 to - 2.36), and -2.33 (-2.62 to -2.04) ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> . Thus, higher SBP-TTR was associated with a decreased risk of CKD progression in patients with CKD.",2023,12,28
Evaluation of soil texture classification from orthodox interpolation and machine learning techniques.,"The current investigation examines the effectiveness of various approaches in predicting the soil texture class (clay, silt, and sand contents) of the Rawalpindi district, Punjab province, Pakistan. The employed techniques included artificial neural networks (ANNs), kriging, co-kriging, and inverse distance weighting (IDW). A total of 44 soil specimens from depths of 10-15 cm were gathered, and then the hydrometer method was adopted to measure their texture. The map of soil grain sets was formulated in the ArcGIS environment, utilizing distinct interpolation approaches. The MATLAB software was used to evaluate soil texture. The gradient fraction, latitude and longitude, elevation, and soil texture fragments of points were proposed to an ANN. Several statistical values, such as correlation coefficient (R), geometric mean error ratios (GMER), and root mean square error (RMSE), were utilized to evaluate the precision of the intended techniques. In assessing grain size and spatial dissemination of clay, silt, and sand, the effectiveness and precision of ANN were superior compared to kriging, co-kriging, and inverse distance weighting. Still, less than a 50% correlation was observed using the ANN. In this examination, the IDW had inferior precision compared to the other approaches. The results demonstrated that the practices produced acceptable results and can be used for future research. Soil texture is among the most central variables that can manipulate agriculture plans. The prepared maps exhibiting the soil texture groups are imperative for crop yield and pastoral scheduling.",2023,12,28
The role of glucose and fructose on lipid droplet metabolism in human normal bronchial and cancer lung cells by Raman spectroscopy.,"Fructose is one of the most important monosaccharides in the human diet that the human body needs for proper metabolism. This paper presents an approach to study biochemical changes caused by sugars in human normal bronchial cells (BEpiC) and human cancer lung cells (A549) by Raman spectroscopy and Raman imaging. Results after supplementation of human bronchial and lung cells with fructose are also discussed and compared with results obtained for pure human bronchial and lung cells. Based on Raman techniques we have proved that peaks at 750 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1126 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1444 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1584 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 2845 cm<sup>-1</sup> can be treated as biomarkers to monitor fructose changes in cells. Results for fructose have been compared with results for glucose. Raman analysis of the bands at 750 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1126 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 1584 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 2845 cm<sup>-1</sup> for pure BEpiC and A549 cells and BEpiC and A549 after supplementation with fructose and glucose are higher after supplementation with fructose in comparison to glucose. The obtained results shed light on the uninvestigated influence of glucose and fructose on lipid droplet metabolism by Raman spectroscopy methods.",2023,12,29

Different responses of Sinorhizobium sp. upon Pb and Zn exposure: Mineralization versus complexation.,"Lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) have been discharged into environment and may negatively impact ecological security. Rhizobia has gained attention due to their involvement in the restoration of metal polluted soils. However, little is known about the responses of rhizobia under Pb and Zn stress, especially the roles played by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in the resistance of these two metals. Here, Sinorhizobium sp. C10 was isolated from soil around a mining area and was exposed to a series of Pb/Zn treatments. The cell morphology and surface mineral crystals, EPS content and fluorescent substances were determined. In addition, the extracellular polysaccharides and proteins were characterized by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that Zn stress induced the synthesis of EPS by C10 cells. Functional groups of polysaccharides (CO) and proteins (C-O/C-N) were involved in complexation with Zn. In contrast, C10 resisted Pb stress by forming lead phosphate (Pb<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) on the cell surface. Galactose (Gal) and tyrosine played key roles in resistance to the Zn toxicity, whereas glucosamine (N-Glc) was converted to glucose in large amounts during extracellular Pb precipitation. Together, this study demonstrated that C10 possessed different strategies to detoxify the two metals, and could provide basis for bioremediation of Pb and Zn polluted sites.",2023,12,29
"Fate, behaviour and microbial response of diluted bitumen and conventional crude spills in a simulated warm freshwater environment.","Diluted bitumen (DB), one of the most transported unconventional crude oils in Canada's pipelines, raises public concerns due to its potential spillage into freshwater environments. This study aimed to compare the fate and behaviour of DB versus conventional crude (CC) in a simulated warm freshwater environment. An equivalent of 10 L of either DB or CC was spilled into 1200 L of North Saskatchewan River (NSR) water containing natural NSR sediment (2.4 kg) in a mesoscale spill tank and its fate and behaviour at air/water temperatures of 18 °C/24 °C were monitored for 56 days. Oil mass distribution analysis showed that 42.3 wt % of CC and 63.6 wt% of DB resided in the oil slicks at the end of 56-day tests, consisting mainly high molecular weight (HMW) compounds (i.e., resins and asphaltenes). The lost oil contained mainly low molecular weight (LMW) compounds (i.e., light saturates and some aromatics) into the atmosphere, water column, and sediment through collective weathering processes. Notably, weathered CC emulsified with water and remained floating until the end, while the weathered DB mat started to lose its buoyancy after 24 days under quiescent conditions and resurfaced once waves were applied. Analysis of the microbial communities of water pre- and post-spills revealed the replacement of indigenous microbial communities with hydrocarbon-degrading species. Exposure to CC reduced the microbial diversity by 12%, while exposure to DB increased the diversity by 10%. During the early stages of the spill (up to Day 21), most dominant species were positively correlated with the benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) content or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content of the water column, while the dominant species at the later stages (Days 21-56) of the spill were negatively correlated with BTEX or PAH content and positively correlated with the total organic carbon (TOC) content in waters.",2023,12,28
Sesquiterpenoid derivatives isolated from a liquid culture of Hypholoma capnoides 819.,"Nine previously undescribed sesquiterpenoids, named as capnoidones A-G (1-6 and 8) and capnoidols A and B (7 and 9), along with three known sesquiterpenoids, fascicularones A, B, and G (12, 11 and 10), were isolated from the fermentation products of the mushroom Hypholoma capnoides 819 (Strophariace). The structures of these compounds were determined through MS and NMR experiments along with electronic circular dichroism analysis. Optical rotation calculations and X-ray diffraction experiments were also conducted for confirmation of the structures. Compounds 1 and 4 displayed mild cytotoxicity towards BV2 microglial cells in mice, while compound 4 exhibited mild cytotoxicity against breast cancer MCF-7 cells. However, none of the compounds demonstrated antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli.",2023,12,29
Review on interactions between nanomaterials and phytohormones: Novel perspectives and opportunities for mitigating environmental challenges.,"Nanotechnology offers the potential to provide innovative solutions for sustainable crop production as plants are exposed to a combination of climate change factors (CO<sub>2</sub>, temperature, UV radiation, ozone), abiotic (heavy metals, salinity, drought), and biotic (virus, bacteria, fungi, nematode, and insects) stresses. The application of particular sizes, shapes, and concentration of nanomaterials (NMs) potentially mitigate the negative impacts in plants by modulation of photosynthetic rate, redox homeostasis, hormonal balance, and nutrient assimilation through upregulation of anti-stress metabolites, antioxidant defense pathways, and genes and genes network. The present review inculcates recent advances in uptake, translocation, and accumulation mechanisms of NMs in plants. The critical theme of this review provides detailed insights into different physiological, biochemical, molecular, and stress tolerance mechanism(s) of NMs action and their cross-talk with different phytohormones. The role of NMs as a double-edged sword for climate change factors, abiotic, and biotic stresses for nutrients uptake, hormones synthesis, cytotoxic, and genotoxic effects including chromosomal aberration, and micronuclei synthesis have been extensively studied. Importantly, this review aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the hormesis effect at low and toxicity at higher doses of NMs under different stressors to develop innovative approaches and design smart NMs for sustainable crop production.",2023,12,28

Co-culture platform for tuning of cancer receptor density allows for evaluation of bispecific immune cell engagers.,"Cancer immunotherapy, where a patient's immune system is harnessed to eradicate cancer cells selectively, is a leading strategy for cancer treatment. However, successes with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are hampered by reported systemic and organ-specific toxicities and by two-thirds of the patients being non-responders or subsequently acquiring resistance to approved ICIs. Hence substantial efforts are invested in discovering novel targeted immunotherapies aimed at reduced side-effects and improved potency. One way is utilizing the dual targeting feature of bispecific antibodies, which have made them increasingly popular for cancer immunotherapy. Easy and predictive screening methods for activation ranking of candidate drugs in tumor contra non-tumor environments are however lacking. Herein, we present a cell-based assay mimicking the tumor microenvironment by co-culturing B cells with engineered human embryonic kidney 293 T cells (HEK293T), presenting a controllable density of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ). A target density panel with three different surface protein levels on HEK293T cells was established by genetic constructs carrying regulatory elements limiting RNA translation of PDGFRβ. We employed a bispecific antibody-affibody construct called an AffiMab capable of binding PDGFRβ on cancer cells and CD40 expressed by B cells as a model. Specific activation of CD40-mediated signaling of immune cells was demonstrated with the two highest receptor-expressing cell lines, Level 2/3 and Level 4, while low-to-none in the low-expressing cell lines. The concept of receptor tuning and the presented co-culture protocol may be of general utility for assessing and developing novel bi-specific antibodies for immuno-oncology applications.",2023,12,28
The role of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway during the progress and therapy of diabetic retinopathy.,"Diabetic retinopathy is a complex and progressive ocular complication of diabetes mellitus and is a leading cause of blindness in people of working age worldwide. The pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy involves multifactorial processes, including oxidative stress, inflammation and vascular abnormalities. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis is essential for the development of effective therapeutic interventions. One of the pathways receiving increasing attention is the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, which regulates the cellular response to oxidative stress by activating Nrf2. In this review, we analyze the current evidence linking Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway dysregulation to diabetic retinopathy. In addition, we explore the potential therapeutic implications and the challenges of targeting this pathway for disease management. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms of diabetic retinopathy and the therapeutic potential of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway may pave the way for innovative and effective interventions to combat this vision-threatening disease.",2023,12,28
Endoplasmic reticulum stress and its role in various neurodegenerative diseases.,"The Endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a critical cellular organelle, maintains cellular homeostasis by regulating calcium levels and orchestrating essential functions such as protein synthesis, folding, and lipid production. A pivotal aspect of ER function is its role in protein quality control. When misfolded proteins accumulate within the ER due to factors like protein folding chaperone dysfunction, toxicity, oxidative stress, or inflammation, it triggers the Unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR involves the activation of chaperones like calnexin, calreticulin, glucose-regulating protein 78 (GRP78), and Glucose-regulating protein 94 (GRP94), along with oxidoreductases like protein disulphide isomerases (PDIs). Cells employ the Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) mechanism to counteract protein misfolding. ERAD disruption causes the detachment of GRP78 from transmembrane proteins, initiating a cascade involving Inositol-requiring kinase/endoribonuclease 1 (IRE1), Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and Protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) pathways. The accumulation and deposition of misfolded proteins within the cell are hallmarks of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. These aberrant proteins disrupt normal neuronal signalling and contribute to impaired cellular homeostasis, including oxidative stress and compromised protein degradation pathways. In essence, ER stress is defined as the cellular response to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, encompassing a series of signalling pathways and molecular events that aim to restore cellular homeostasis. This comprehensive review explores ER stress and its profound implications for the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative diseases.",2023,12,29
Bacterial and fungal isolates from 107 cases of ulcerative keratitis in Japanese Thoroughbred racehorses (2017-2021).,"Infectious ulcerative keratitis is a common disease in racehorses. To improve treatment outcomes, this study aimed to assess the antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacterial and fungal isolates obtained from the cornea of Japanese Thoroughbred racehorses with equine infectious ulcerative keratitis. Bacterial and fungal cultures were performed for 166 corneal swabs from 107 cases. A disc diffusion test and minimum inhibitory concentration test were also performed to assess antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial and fungal isolates, respectively. Bacterial and/or fungal isolates were obtained from 85.0% (91/107) of the cases. Staphylococcus was primarily isolated from bacterial isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Aerococcus, Streptococcus, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas. Aspergillus was primarily isolated from filamentous fungi, and Debaryomyces species was primarily identified in yeast-like fungi. Ofloxacin resistance was observed in 100% (12/12), 15.9% (7/44), and 25.0% (3/12) of MRSA, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus isolates, respectively. The prevalence of quinolone-resistant Staphylococci and Streptococci has increased in the past two decades. All Aspergillus isolates were susceptible to voriconazole, whereas other filamentous fungi, including Fusarium, were less susceptible to voriconazole. Further studies are required to determine effective treatments for antimicrobial-resistant isolates.",2023,12,28
Artesunate attenuates serum amyloid A-induced M1 macrophage differentiation through the promotion of PHGDH.,"Clinical studies indicated that Serum Amyloid A (SAA) might be a promising biomarker for forecasting the activity, severity, and adverse prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Simultaneously, a positive correlation has been observed between macrophages, Th17 cells, and SLE disease activity, with both these immune cells being affected by SAA. Presently, the relationship between SAA and the aforementioned immune cell types in SLE remains to be elucidated. To discern the immune cell type most closely associated with SAA, we undertook a single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis via the GEO database. Subsequent results revealed a strong association between macrophages and SAA, a relationship further validated through flow cytometry of spleen macrophages in the MRL/lpr model. We discovered that SAA stimulate M1 macrophage differentiation along with the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1β. Our findings suggest that SAA may promote M1 macrophage differentiation via the downregulation of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). Artesunate (ART), primarily utilized for malaria treatment, was shown to inhibit M1 macrophage differentiation and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels via upregulating the PHGDH expression, thereby attenuating the disease activity in SLE.",2023,12,29
Suppressing the rhamnogalacturonan lyase gene FaRGLyase1 preserves RGI pectin degradation and enhances strawberry fruit firmness.,"Plant rhamnogalacturonan lyases (RGLyases) cleave the backbone of rhamnogalacturonan I (RGI), the ""hairy"" pectin and polymer of the disaccharide rhamnose (Rha)-galacturonic acid (GalA) with arabinan, galactan or arabinogalactan side chains. It has been suggested that RGLyases could participate in remodeling cell walls during fruit softening, but clear evidence has not been reported. To investigate the role of RGLyases in strawberry softening, a genome-wide analysis of RGLyase genes in the genus Fragaria was performed. Seventeen genes encoding RGLyases with functional domains were identified in Fragaria × ananassa. FaRGLyase1 was the most expressed in the ripe receptacle of cv. Chandler. Transgenic strawberry plants expressing an RNAi sequence of FaRGLyase1 were obtained. Three transgenic lines yielded ripe fruits firmer than controls without other fruit quality parameters being significantly affected. The highest increase in firmness achieved was close to 32%. Cell walls were isolated from ripe fruits of two selected lines. The amount of water-soluble and chelated pectins was higher in transgenic lines than in the control. A carbohydrate microarray study showed a higher abundance of RGI epitopes in pectin fractions and in the cellulose-enriched fraction obtained from transgenic lines. Sixty-seven genes were differentially expressed in transgenic ripe fruits when compared with controls. These genes were involved in various physiological processes, including cell wall remodeling, ion homeostasis, lipid metabolism, protein degradation, stress response, and defense. The transcriptomic changes observed in FaRGLyase1 plants suggest that senescence was delayed in transgenic fruits.",2023,12,23
Management of phenylketonuria in European PKU centres remains heterogeneous.,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder that follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Dietary treatment is the cornerstone of therapy and is based on natural protein restriction, Phe-free L-amino acid supplements (protein substitutes) and low protein foods. The aim of this project was to collect information about the clinical management of patients with PKU, focusing on understudied or unresolved issues such as blood phenylalanine (Phe) fluctuations and clinical symptoms, particularly gastro intestinal (GI) discomfort and sleep problems. The survey consisted of 10 open-ended and 12 multiple-choice questions that collected information about size of the PKU population in each center, the center's clinical practices and the outcomes observed by the center concerning adherence, clinical and biochemical abnormalities and clinical symptoms (GI and sleep). The questionnaire was sent to 72 experts from metabolic centers in 11 European countries. Thirty-three centers answered. The results of this survey provide information about the clinical practice in different age groups, concentrating on dietary tolerance, treatment adherence, and metabolic control. All the centers prescribed a Phe-restricted diet, with Phe-free/low Phe protein substitutes and low protein foods. Daily doses given of protein substitutes varied from 1 to 5, with adherence to the prescribed amounts decreasing with increasing age. Respondents identified that improvement in the flavor, taste, volume and smell of protein substitutes may improve adherence. Finally, the survey showed that clinical symptoms, such as GI discomfort and sleep problems occur in patients with PKU but are not systematically evaluated. Twenty-four-hour Phe fluctuations were not routinely assessed. The results highlight a strong heterogeneity of approach to management despite international PKU guidelines. More clinical attention should be given to gastrointestinal and sleep problems in PKU.",2023,12,23
Combined effects of climate warming and pharmaceuticals on a tri-trophic freshwater food web.,"Multiple anthropogenic stressors influence the functioning of lakes and ponds, but their combined effects are often little understood. We conducted two mesocosm experiments to evaluate the effects of warming (+4 °C above ambient temperature) and environmentally relevant concentrations of a mixture of commonly used pharmaceuticals (cardiovascular, psychoactive, antihistamines, antibiotics) on tri-trophic food webs representative of communities in ponds and other small standing waters. Communities were constituted of phyto- and zooplankton and macroinvertebrates (molluscs and insects) including benthic detritivores, grazers, omnivorous scrapers, omnivorous piercers, water column predators, benthic predators, and phytophilous predators. We quantified the main and interactive effects of warming and pharmaceuticals on each trophic level in the pelagic community and attributed them to the direct effects of both stressors and the indirect effects arising through biotic interactions. Warming and pharmaceuticals had stronger effects in the summer experiment, altering zooplankton community composition and causing delayed or accelerated emergence of top insect predators (odonates). In the summer experiment, both stressors and top predators reduced the biomass of filter-feeding zooplankton (cladocerans), while warming and pharmaceuticals had opposite effects on phytoplankton. In the winter experiment, the effects were much weaker and were limited to a positive effect of warming on phytoplankton biomass. Overall, we show that pharmaceuticals can exacerbate the effects of climate warming in freshwater ecosystems, especially during the warm season. Our results demonstrate the utility of community-level studies across seasons for risk assessment of multiple emerging stressors in freshwater ecosystems.",2023,12,26
An Online Support Vector Machine Algorithm for Dynamic Social Network Monitoring.,"Online monitoring of social networks offers exciting features for platforms, enabling both technical and behavioral analysis. Numerous studies have explored the adaptation of traditional quality control methods for detecting change points within social networks. However, the current research studies face limitations such as an overreliance on case-based attributes, high computational costs, poor scalability with large networks, and low sensitivity in fast change point detection. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for social network monitoring using One-Class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVMs) to address these limitations. Additionally, using both nodal and network-level attributes makes it versatile for diverse social network applications and effectively detecting network disturbances. The algorithm utilizes a well-defined training data dictionary with an updating procedure for evolutionary networks, enhancing memory and time efficiency by reducing the processing of input data. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted using an EpiCNet model to simulate interactions in an online social network, covering six change scenarios to evaluate the proposed methodology. The results show lower Average Run Length (ARL) and Expected Delay Detection (EDD), demonstrating the superior accuracy and effectiveness of the OC-SVM algorithm compared to alternative methods. Applying OC-SVM to the Enron Email network indicates its capability to identify change points, reflecting the tumultuous timeline that led to Enron's downfall. This further validates the substantial advancement of OC-SVM in social network monitoring and opens doors to broader real-world applications.",2023,12,15

Perceptual addition of continuous magnitudes in an 'artificial algebra'.,"Although there is substantial evidence for an innate 'number sense' that scaffolds learning about mathematics, whether the underlying representations are based on discrete or continuous perceptual magnitudes has been controversial. Yet the nature of the computations supported by these representations has been neglected in this debate. While basic computation of discrete non-symbolic quantities has been reliably demonstrated in adults, infants, and non-humans, far less consideration has been given to the capacity for computation of continuous perceptual magnitudes. Here we used a novel experimental task to ask if humans can learn to add non-symbolic, continuous magnitudes in accord with the properties of an algebraic group, by feedback and without explicit instruction. Three pairs of experiments tested perceptual addition under the group properties of commutativity (Experiments 1a-b), identity and inverses (Experiments 2a-b) and associativity (Experiments 3a-b), with both line length and brightness modalities. Transfer designs were used in which participants responded on trials with feedback based on sums of magnitudes and later were tested with novel stimulus configurations. In all experiments, correlations of average responses with magnitude sums were high on trials with feedback. Responding on transfer trials was accurate and provided strong support for addition under all of the group axioms with line length, and for all except associativity with brightness. Our results confirm that adult human subjects can implicitly add continuous quantities in a manner consistent with symbolic addition over the integers, and that an 'artificial algebra' task can be used to study implicit computation.",2023,12,28
Selective enrichment of virulence factor genes in the plastisphere under antibiotic and heavy metal pressures.,"The growing accumulation of plastic waste in the environment has created novel habitats known as the ""plastisphere"", where microorganisms can thrive. Concerns are rising about the potential for pathogenic microorganisms to proliferate in the plastisphere, posing risks to human health. However, our knowledge regarding the virulence and pathogenic potential of these microorganisms in the plastisphere remains limited. This study quantified the abundance of virulence factor genes (VFGs) in the plastisphere and its surrounding environments (water and soil) to better assess pathogenic risks. Our findings revealed a selective enrichment of VFGs in the plastisphere, which were attributed to the specific microbial community assembled. The presence of arsenic and ciprofloxacin in the plastisphere exerted additional co-selective pressures, intensifying the enrichment of VFGs. Notably, VFGs that encoded multiple functions or enhanced the survival of host microorganisms (e.g., encoding adherence functions) tended to accumulate in the plastisphere. These versatile and environmentally adaptable VFGs are more likely to be favored by bacteria in the environment, warranting increased attention in future investigations due to their potential for widespread dissemination. In terms of virulence and pathogenicity, this research offers new insights into evaluating pathogen-related risks in the plastisphere.",2023,12,27
Neural networks with ReLU powers need less depth.,"Despite the widespread success of deep learning in various applications, neural network theory has been lagging behind. The choice of the activation function plays a critical role in the expressivity of a neural network but for reasons that are not yet fully understood. While the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is currently one of the most popular activation functions, ReLU squared has only recently been empirically shown to be pivotal in producing consistently superior results for state-of-the-art deep learning tasks (So et al., 2021). To analyze the expressivity of neural networks with ReLU powers, we employ the novel framework of Gribonval et al. (2022) based on the classical concept of approximation spaces. We consider the class of functions for which the approximation error decays at a sufficiently fast rate as network complexity, measured by the number of weights, increases. We show that when approximating sufficiently smooth functions that cannot be represented by sufficiently low-degree polynomials, networks with ReLU powers need less depth than those with ReLU. Moreover, if they have the same depth, networks with ReLU powers can have potentially faster approximation rates. Lastly, our computational experiments on approximating the Rastrigin and Ackley functions with deep neural networks showed that ReLU squared and ReLU cubed networks consistently outperform ReLU networks.",2023,12,19

"Design, synthesis, molecular docking and biological evaluation of 1,3,5-trisubstituted-1H-pyrazole derivatives as anticancer agents with cell cycle arrest, ERK and RIPK3- kinase activities.","The need for new ERK and RIPK3 kinase modulators arises from their central roles in cellular processes, especially in diseases like cancer. This research focused on a ligand-based strategy, incorporating previously documented 1,3,5-trisubstituted-1H-pyrazole derivatives, to craft innovative inhibitors specifically targeting ERK and RIPK3 kinases. Compounds 6, 7, 10a, 10c, and 10d exhibited significant cytotoxicity against PC-3 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 21.9 to 28.6 µM and 3.90-35.5 µM, respectively values surpassing those of the reference compound Doxorubicin. Additionally, cell cycle analysis revealed intriguing results, particularly with 10d inducing cell cycle arrest at the S phase in treated PC-3 cells, indicating potential DNA replication phase inhibition. Moreover, compounds 6, 10a, and 10d exhibited promising results in the in vitro kinase assay supported by molecular docking studies. The core scaffold of these compounds established interactions with vital amino acids within the active pockets of ERK and RIPK3 kinases, thereby securely anchoring them in place. These findings underscore the development of promising modulators for ERK and RIPK3 kinases, suggesting their potential for future contributions to cancer treatments.",2023,12,28
Double metals sites synergistically enhanced photocatalytic N<sub>2</sub> fixation performance over Bi<sub>24</sub>O<sub>31</sub>Br<sub>10</sub>@Bi/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> Ohm junctions.,"At present, it is a research hotspot to realize green synthetic ammonia by using solar energy. Exploring cheap and efficient co-catalysts for enhancing the performance of photocatalysts is a challenge in the field of energy conversion. In order to boost the charge separation/transfer of the photocatalyst and widen the visible light absorption, Bi<sub>24</sub>O<sub>31</sub>Br<sub>10</sub>@Bi/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> with double Ohm junction is successfully fabricated by in situ growth of metal Bi and loading Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene on the surface of Bi<sub>24</sub>O<sub>31</sub>Br<sub>10</sub>. The dual active sites of Bi and Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene not only broaden the light adsorption of Bi<sub>24</sub>O<sub>31</sub>Br<sub>10</sub> but also serve as excellent 'electronic receptor' for synergically enhancing the separation/transfer efficiency of photogenerated electrons/holes.

A time-multiplexed self-erasing nanopaper for water induced information transmission.,"The progressive presentation of multilevel information enhances the security level of information storage and transmission. Here, a time-multiplexed self-erasing nanopaper was developed by integrating cellulose nanofiber (CNF)-stabilized gold nanoclusters and CNF-modified long afterglow materials. The orange fluorescence of gold nanoclusters on nanopaper was regulated by the reversible swelling and shrinking of CNF induced by water solution, while the cyan fluorescence of micron-long afterglow remained stable and acted as the background signal. It was noteworthy that the fluorescence colour and intensity of the nanopaper could be freely adjusted between orange and cyan on the time scale. Therefore, the array information on the nanopaper could be encoded by a water solution, iterated variation as the step-by-step solvent volatilized on the time scale measured by the time of the afterglow duration. This work provides a new approach for constructing time-multiplexed self-erasing nanopaper for confidential information storage and transmission.",2023,12,24
Nanosheet-structured ZnCo-LDH microsphere as active material for rechargeable zinc batteries.,"We report zinc cobalt-layered double hydroxides (ZnCo-LDH) as the active cathode materials for the development of high-performance Zn-ZnCo batteries. Electrochemical investigations show the battery's capacity increases linearly with increasing the ZnCo-LDH loading (up to 60 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>). The resulting Zn-ZnCo battery exhibits excellent rate performance and cycle stability, retaining 86% of its capacity even after 5000 cycles of testing. By incorporating ZnCo-LDH with a Pt/C-coated gas diffusion layer to form an integrated multifunctional air-cathode, we demonstrate a hybrid Zn battery, which combines the merits of Zn-ZnCo and Zn-air batteries to show a characteristic two-stage charge-discharge voltage profile. The current work demonstrates the linear relationship between the battery capacity and the active material loading. The results also highlight that a greater battery capacity requires further increasing of loading though very challenging.",2023,12,23

Astrocyte S100β expression and selective differentiation to GFAP and GS in the entorhinal cortex during ageing in the 3xTg-Alzheimer's disease mouse model.,"The study of astrocytes and its role in the development and evolution of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential to fully understand their aetiology. The aim if this study is to deepen into the concept of the heterogeneity of astrocyte subpopulations in the EC and in particular the identification of differentially functioning astrocyte subpopulations that respond differently to AD progression. S100β protein belongs to group of small calcium regulators of cell membrane channels and pumps that are expressed by astrocytes and is hypothesised to play and have a relevant role in AD development. We analysed the selective differentiation of S100β-positive astrocytes into Glutamine synthetase (GS) and Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive sub-groups in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of AD triple transgenic animal model (3xTg-AD). EC is the brain region earliest affected in humans AD but also in this closest animal model regarding their pathology and time course. We observed no changes in the number of S100β-positive astrocytes between 1 and 18 months of age in the EC of 3xTg-AD mice. However, we identified relevant morphological changes in S100β/GFAP positive astrocytes showing a significant reduction in their surface and volume whilst an increase in number and percentage. Furthermore, the percentage of S100β/GS positive astrocyte population was also increased in 18 months old 3xTg-AD mice compared to the non-Tg mice. Our findings reveal the presence of differentially controlled astrocyte populations that respond differently to AD progression in the EC of 3xTg-AD mice. These results highpoints the major astrocytic role together with its early and marked affection in AD and arguing in favour of its importance in neurogenerative diseases and potential target for new therapeutic approaches.",2023,12,29

NK-derived exosome miR-1249-3p inhibits Mycobacterium tuberculosis survival in macrophages by targeting SKOR1.,"Murine Natural Killer cells were cultivated in vitro to isolate NK-derived exosomes. Subsequent quantification via qPCR confirmed enrichment of miR-1249-3p. Ana-1 murine macrophages were cultured in vitro and subsequently inoculated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strain H37Rv. NK-exo and NK-exo miR-1249-3p were separately applied to the infection model, followed by immunological assays conducted post-48-hour co-culture. Western blot analyses corroborated that NK-exo exhibited exosomal marker proteins Granzyme A (GzmA), Granzyme B (GzmB), and Perforin (PFN), alongside a notable enrichment of miR-1249-3p. Functionally, NK-exo augmented the expression levels of Caspase-9,-8, and -3, as well as PARP, while attenuating the expression of NLRP3, ASC, and Cleaved-Caspase-1. Furthermore, qPCR demonstrated an up-regulation of Caspase-9, -8, and -3, along with pro-apoptotic factors Bax and Bid, and a concomitant down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2. The expression levels of inflammatory markers ASC, NLRP3, Cleaved-Caspase-1, and IL-1β were concomitantly decreased. ELISA findings indicated diminished levels of TNF-α and ROS secretion. NK-exo miR-1249-3p specifically targeted and attenuated the expression of SKOR-1, engendering up-regulation of apoptosis-associated proteins and down-regulation of inflammation-related proteins, consequently affecting cellular fate.Our empirical evidence substantiates that NK-exo induces macrophage apoptosis, thereby mitigating MTB survival. Furthermore, NK-exo miR-1249-3p directly targets and inhibits SKOR-1 expression, leading to macrophage apoptosis and consequently hampering the proliferation of MTB. The data implicate the potential therapeutic relevance of NK-exo and miR-1249-3p in managing drug-resistant tuberculosis.",2023,12,29
Adolescent-onset multisystem proteinopathy due to a novel VCP variant.,"Valosin-containing protein (VCP) pathogenic variants are the most common cause of multisystem proteinopathy presenting with inclusion body myopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, and Paget disease of bone in isolation or in combination. We report a patient manifesting with adolescent-onset myopathy caused by a novel heterozygous VCP variant (c.467G > T, p.Gly156Val). The myopathy manifested asymmetrically in lower limbs and extended to proximal, axial, and upper limb muscles, with loss of ambulation at age 35. Creatine kinase value was normal. Alkaline phosphatase was elevated. Electromyography detected mixed low amplitude, short duration and high amplitude, long duration motor unit potentials. Muscle biopsy showed features of inclusion body myopathy, which in combination with newly diagnosed Paget disease of bone, supported the VCP variant pathogenicity. In conclusion, VCP-multisystem proteinopathy is not only a disease of adulthood but can have a pediatric onset and should be considered in differential diagnosis of neuromuscular weakness in the pediatric population.",2023,12,10
"Integrated computational approaches for designing potent pyrimidine-based CDK9 inhibitors: 3D-QSAR, docking, and molecular dynamics simulations.","CDK9 is an emerging target for the development of anticancer drugs. The development of CDK9 inhibitors with significant potency had consistently posed a formidable challenge. In the current research, a number of computational methodologies, such as, 3D-QSAR, molecular docking, fingerprint analysis, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations followed by MMGB/PBSA and ADMET studies were used systemically to uncover the binding mechanism of pyrimidine derivatives against CDK9. The CoMFA and CoMSIA models having high q<sup>2</sup> (0.53, 0.54) and r<sup>2</sup> values (0.96, 0.93) respectively indicating that model could accurately predict the bioactivities of CDK9 inhibitors. Using the R-group exploration technique implemented by the Spark™ by Cresset group, the structural requirements revealed by the contour maps of model were utilized strategically to create an in-house library of 100 new CDK9 inhibitors. Additionally, the compounds from the in-house library were mapped into 3D-QSAR model which predicted pIC<sub>50</sub> values comparable to the experimental values. A comparison between 3D-QSAR generated contours and molecular docking conformation of ligands was performed to elucidate the essentials of CDK9 inhibitor design. MD simulations (100 ns) were performed on the selected docked complexes A21, A14 and D98 which contributed in validating the binding interactions. According to the findings of binding free energy analysis (MMGB/PBSA), It was observed that residues CYS106 and GLU107 had a considerable tendency to facilitate ligand-protein interactions via H-bond interactions. The aforementioned findings have the potential to enhance researchers comprehension of the mechanism underlying CDK9 inhibition and may be utilized in the development of innovative and efficacious CDK9 inhibitors.",2023,12,12
Influence of the solvent on the sensitization of nanostructured electrodes of TiO<sub>2</sub> for solar cells sensitized with a natural dye extracted from purple corn: Molecular dynamic simulation and experimental validation.,"This study uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experiments to explore the interaction between titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), the main compound in purple corn, in the context of sensitized solar cells. dyes (DSSCs). Different proportions of water and ethanol in the solvent were applied. MD revealed the effective chemisorption of C3G and significant variations in the equilibrium enthalpy, indicating the influence of the solvent composition on the stability of the TiO<sub>2</sub>/C3G system. The negative adsorption energies (E<sub>Ads</sub>) reveal favourable adsorption processes. A possible formation of solvation shells was observed near the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle. The experimental results supported the simulation predictions, highlighting the system with 25 % water and 75 % ethanol (W1E3) as the most efficient.

Effects on the accelerating electron bunches due to the presence of sulfur hexafluoride or air in the linac waveguide.,"Sulfur hexafluoride gas (SF6) is used as a dielectric insulator in the acceleration process of certain medical linear accelerator waveguides. Nevertheless, some innovative development and investigation cases require intervention in the linear accelerator or, specifically, on the waveguide, which could affect the sealing of the device. In this regard, vacuum sealing systems can be compromised, affecting the properties of the radiation beams produced. The presence of sulfur hexafluoride or air inside the VARIAN 6/100 waveguide was investigated under different pressure conditions and non-uniform electric fields, adapting Monte Carlo simulation techniques for modeling radiation transport coupled with electric fields.

A case report on concomitant reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome and transient global amnesia.,"Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome clinically presents as severe headaches with or without neurological deficits accompanied by multilocal caliber variation of the cerebral arteries on imaging studies. Transient Global Amnesia is a benign neurological condition that implies sudden temporary antero- and retrograde amnesia. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms involved in transient global amnesia and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome remain unclear but suggest similar pathways as both can be triggered by factors that activate the sympathetic nervous system. We herein discuss a potential relationship of the two conditions in a 65-year-old woman that initially presented herself to the emergency department with temporary memory impairment, indicating Transient Global Amnesia. Four days later, the patient revealed a thunderclap headache accompanied by a subarachnoid hemorrhage with transient segmental narrowing of the arteries of the anterior circulation on neuroimaging. In this case report we hypothesize that Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome might be a potential cause for the clinical symptoms and imaging patterns with Transient Global Amnesia as a possible prodromal stage of Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome.",2023,12,05

Enhanced responses to inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 in micropatterned networks of cultured cortical neurons.,"Cortical neurons in dissociated cultures are an indispensable model system for pharmacological research that provides insights into chemical responses in well-defined environments. However, cortical neurons plated on homogeneous substrates develop an unstructured network that exhibits excessively synchronized activity, which occasionally masks the consequences induced by external substances. Here, we show that hyperactivity and excessive synchrony in cultured cortical networks can be effectively suppressed by growing neurons in microfluidic devices. These devices feature a hierarchically modular design that resembles the in vivo network. We focused on interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and assessed its acute and chronic effects. Fluorescence calcium imaging of spontaneous neural activity for up to 20 days of culture showed detectable modulation of collective activity events and neural correlation in micropatterned neurons, which was not apparent in neurons cultured on homogeneous substrates. Our results indicate that engineered neuronal networks provide a unique platform for detecting and understanding the fundamental effects of biochemical compounds on neuronal networks.",2023,12,21
Perioperative acute kidney injury: The renoprotective effect and mechanism of dexmedetomidine.,"Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a highly selective and potent α2-adrenoceptor (α2-AR) agonist that is widely used as a clinical anesthetic to induce anxiolytic, sedative, and analgesic effects. In recent years, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that DEX protects against acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by sepsis, drugs, surgery, and ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) in organs or tissues, indicating its potential role in the prevention and treatment of AKI. In this review, we summarized the evidence of the renoprotective effects of DEX on different models of AKI and explored the mechanism. We found that the renoprotective effects of DEX mainly involved antisympathetic effects, reducing inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress, reducing apoptosis, increasing autophagy, reducing ferroptosis, protecting renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs), and inhibiting renal fibrosis. Thus, the use of DEX is a promising strategy for the management and treatment of perioperative AKI. The aim of this review is to further clarify the renoprotective mechanism of DEX to provide a theoretical basis for its use in basic research in various AKI models, clinical management, and the treatment of perioperative AKI.",2023,12,23
Effect of temperature on growth and yessotoxin production of Protoceratium reticulatum and Lingulodinium polyedra (Dinophyceae) isolates from the Portuguese coast (NE Atlantic).,"The dinoflagellates Protoceratium reticulatum and Lingulodinium polyedra are potential yessotoxin (YTX) producers, which have been associated with blooms responsible for economic, social, and ecological impacts around the world. They occur in Iberian waters, but in this region, little is known of their ecophysiology and toxin profiles. This study investigated the growth and toxin production of two strains of each species, from the Portuguese coast, at 15 °C, 19 °C, and 23 °C. Growth curves showed higher growth rates at 19 °C, for both species. YTX and three analogs (homo YTX; 45-OH YTX; 45-OH homo YTX) were investigated by Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the presence of other analogs was investigated by Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS). No evidence of toxin production was found in L. polyedra. By contrast, YTX and 45,55-diOH-YTX were detected in both strains of P. reticulatum. These results confirm P. reticulatum as a source of yessotoxins along the Portuguese coast and add to the observed high intraspecific variability on YTX production of both species, at a global scale.",2023,12,27
Identifying loss threshold and migration trajectory in the management of Suaeda salsa wetland under coastal squeeze.,"The coastal salt marsh wetland is mainly located in the tidal area where sea and land are intertwined, which has the functions of promoting silt and consolidating beach, wave reduction and disaster reduction, and is an ecological barrier against erosion in the coastal zone, which has important ecological value. Nevertheless, owing to the intricate nature of wetland species formation mechanisms and community distribution patterns, the impact of coastal squeeze on Suaeda salsa wetlands loss may not exhibit a linear relationship, necessitating further elucidation of the specific processes involved. Precisely understanding the extent to which coastal squeeze affects the threshold of loss in the Suaeda salsa wetland holds immense importance in safeguarding the distinctive red beach landscape. Furthermore, it represents a pivotal scientific challenge that necessitates resolution in the management of coastal wetlands for their protection and restoration. Hence, drawing upon the theoretical framework concerning the impact of coastal squeeze on the degradation of coastal Suaeda salsa wetland, this study employs the representative silty coastal region of China's northern Liaodong Bay as a case study to conduct empirical investigation. The research integrates Landsat imagery and digital elevation data, and incorporates spatial autocorrelation, elastic coefficient analysis, and barycenter model analysis to examine the threshold of degradation and spatial variations of Suaeda salsa wetland in response to coastal squeeze. The results show that: (1) The risk intensity of coastal squeeze in the study area exhibited a pattern of initial decline followed by an increase from 1995 to 2020, with the highest risk areas predominantly located in the development zone on the eastern bank of the Liao River Estuary. (2) There was a positive correlation between the growth of the coastal squeeze index and the loss of the Suaeda salsa wetland. When the proportion of area in which the coastal squeeze deteriorates reached 43.9%, the Suaeda salsa wetland lose resilience against the impact of coastal squeeze, leading to an intensified rate of loss. (3) Compared with the west side of the Liao River, the critical area of coastal squeeze and the loss barycenter of the Suaeda salsa wetland on the east side of the Liao River have a greater range of changes. The planning and management of coastal ecological restoration necessitates considering the occurrence conditions of the coastal squeeze impact threshold on the loss threshold of wetland and the migration characteristics of the wetland loss area. This approach enables the timely control of coastal squeeze risk intensity in the area and the preservation of wetlands' resistance to external disturbances. Consequently, it holds immense importance for the sustainable development of coastal wetlands.",2023,12,25
BART: A transferable liquid chromatography retention time library for bile acids.,"Identification of unknown bile acids, especially the distinguishment between isomers, requires retention times of a large number of reference standards, which are often not commercially available. Meanwhile, published retention information cannot be directly transferred across labs due to the differences between liquid chromatography (LC) systems, such as different extra column volume and dwell volume. To improve this situation, a transferrable retention time library for bile acids named BART was developed. BART was composed of isocratic retention models of 272 bile acids and a software tool to predict their gradient retention times on various LC systems. The isocratic retention times of bile acids were acquired on a Waters BEH C18 column with mobile phases of acidic ammonium acetate buffer and acetonitrile, and fit to the quadratic solvent strength model (QSSM). Segmented linear gradient retention times were calculated with holdup time (t<sub>0</sub>), dwell time (t<sub>D</sub>) and actual gradient profile corrected using 21 bile acid calibration standards. In addition to the reference system where the isocratic retention times were acquired, this approach has been validated on four other LC-MS systems in four labs with two gradient methods. Average root mean square errors (RMSE) between predicted and experimental retention times were 0.052 and 0.054 min for the two gradients tested, which were 9-fold more accurate than referring to a static retention time library. The library is freely available at https://bafinder.github.io/.",2023,12,23
DeepGraFT: A novel semantic segmentation auxiliary ROI-based deep learning framework for effective fundus tessellation classification.,"Fundus tessellation (FT) is a prevalent clinical feature associated with myopia and has implications in the development of myopic maculopathy, which causes irreversible visual impairment. Accurate classification of FT in color fundus photo can help predict the disease progression and prognosis. However, the lack of precise detection and classification tools has created an unmet medical need, underscoring the importance of exploring the clinical utility of FT. Thus, to address this gap, we introduce an automatic FT grading system (called DeepGraFT) using classification-and-segmentation co-decision models by deep learning. ConvNeXt, utilizing transfer learning from pretrained ImageNet weights, was employed for the classification algorithm, aligning with a region of interest based on the ETDRS grading system to boost performance. A segmentation model was developed to detect FT exits, complementing the classification for improved grading accuracy. The training set of DeepGraFT was from our in-house cohort (MAGIC), and the validation sets consisted of the rest part of in-house cohort and an independent public cohort (UK Biobank). DeepGraFT demonstrated a high performance in the training stage and achieved an impressive accuracy in validation phase (in-house cohort: 86.85 %; public cohort: 81.50 %). Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that DeepGraFT surpasses machine learning-based classification models in FT classification, achieving a 5.57 % increase in accuracy. Ablation analysis revealed that the introduced modules significantly enhanced classification effectiveness and elevated accuracy from 79.85 % to 86.85 %. Further analysis using the results provided by DeepGraFT unveiled a significant negative association between FT and spherical equivalent (SE) in the UK Biobank cohort. In conclusion, DeepGraFT accentuates potential benefits of the deep learning model in automating the grading of FT and allows for potential utility as a clinical-decision support tool for predicting progression of pathological myopia.",2023,12,23

Zn-coordination polymers for fluorescence sensing various contaminants in water.,"Luminescent coordination polymers (LCPs) have garnered significant attention from researchers as promising materials for detecting contaminants. In this paper, three new LCPs ([Zn(tib)(opda)]<sub>n</sub>⋅H<sub>2</sub>O (1), [Zn<sub>3</sub>(tib)<sub>2</sub>(mpda)<sub>3</sub>]<sub>n</sub>⋅5H<sub>2</sub>O (2), [Zn (tib)(ppda)]<sub>n</sub>⋅H<sub>2</sub>O (3)) with different structures (LCP 1-3: 1D, 2D, 1D) using phenylenediacetic acid isomers and 1,3,5-tris (1-imidazolyl) benzene (tib) are synthesized. The specific surface areas (BET) of LCP 1-3 are 4 m<sup>2</sup>/g, 19 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and 13 m<sup>2</sup>/g respectively. LCP 1-3 exhibit excellent fluorescence properties and can serve as fluorescent probe for the detection of inorganic contaminants and organic contaminants. Due to the large BET of LCP 2, the detection limits for trace analytes surpass those of LCP 1 and 3. The detection limits of LCP 2 for Fe<sup>3+</sup>, nitrobenzene (NB), chloramphenicol (CAP), and pyrimethanil (PTH) are 8.3 nM, 0.016 μM, 0.19 μM, and 0.032 μM, respectively, and the fluorescence quenching rates are 98.6 %, 98.8 %, 92.3 %, and 98.8 %, respectively. These values outperform most reported in the literature. The quantum yields of LCP 1-3 are 11.84 %, 25.22 %, 22.00 % respectively. Real sample testing of LCP 1-3 reveals favorable performance, where spiked recoveries of LCP 2 for the detection of pyrimethanil in grape skins ranged from 99.62 % to 119.3 % with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.627 % to 4.56 % (n = 3). The fluorescence quenching mechanism was attributed to a combination of photoelectron transfer (PET), resonance energy transfer (RET), and competitive absorption (CA). This study advances the application of LCPs in luminescence sensing and contributes to the expansion of novel materials for detecting environmental pollutants.",2023,12,27
Recovery of metal ion resources from waste lithium batteries by in situ electro-leaching coupled with electrochemically switched ion exchange.,"A new green pathway of in situ electro-leaching coupled with electrochemically switched ion exchange (EL-ESIX) technology was developed for the separation and recovery of valuable metal ions from waste lithium batteries. By using the in situ electro-leaching, the leaching rates of Li<sup>+</sup> and Co<sup>2+</sup> from the prepared LiCoO<sub>2</sub> film electrodes reached 100 % and 93.30 %, respectively, under the combined effect of the acidic microenvironment formed by the anodic electrolytic water and electrostatic repulsion. Subsequently, the Li<sup>+</sup> in the electrolyte was further extracted by an electrochemically switched ion exchange (ESIX) process using LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as the film electrode, and Li<sup>+</sup> was further enriched in the eluate by a cyclic adsorption and desorption process. The results indicate that the in situ electro-leaching has significant advantages over powder leaching, and for the recycling of waste lithium batteries, the final lithium recovery rate reached 94.51 % by using this in situ EL-ESIX technology.",2023,12,29
Exclusive breastfeeding may be a protective factor in individuals with familial multiple sclerosis. A population registry-based case-control study.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that affects the central nervous system, which most likely results from the interplay between environmental and genetic factors.

Standoff trace explosives vapor detection at meter distances.,"Vapor detection is a noncontact sampling method, which is a less invasive means of explosives screening than physical swiping. Explosive vapor detection is a challenge due to the low levels of vapors available for detection. This study demonstrates that the parts-per-quadrillion sensitivity of atmospheric flow tube-mass spectrometry (AFT-MS) combined with a high-volume air sampler enables standoff detection of trace explosives vapor at distances of centimeters to meters. Standoff detection of explosives vapor was possible both upstream and downstream of the vapor source relative to room air currents. RDX vapor from a saturated source was detected at up to 2.5 m. Vapors from RDX residue and nitroglycerin residue were detected at distances up to 0.5 m. The sampling can be optimized by accounting for air movement in the room or environment, which could further extend standoff detection distances. Using AFT-MS with a high-volume sampler could also be effective for standoff vapor detection of drugs and additional chemical threats and could be useful for security screening applications such as at mail facilities, border crossings, and security checkpoints.",2023,12,16
Development of an activatable Lysosome-targeted fluorescent probe for the detection of endogenous ONOO<sup>-</sup> levels.,"The liver plays a crucial role in several important processes in the human body, including metabolism, detoxification, and immune function. When the liver experiences acute injury, it can cause significant harm and requires prompt detection. Traditional biomarkers lack specificity and cannot detect changes in real-time, making them unsuitable for monitoring pathological processes. Recent studies have shown that acute liver injury (ALI) is closely related to oxidative stress, with peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>-</sup>) being a vital byproduct of liver metabolism and become a critical biomarker for detecting liver damage. As a result, this research developed an activatable near-infrared fluorescent probe W-3a that can be used to detect endogenous ONOO<sup>-</sup> in a mouse model of ALI induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The probe has high selectivity and anti-interference ability, with a reaction time <10 min and a detection limit of 85 nM. It was successfully utilized in detecting endogenous ONOO<sup>-</sup> in cells and live imaging of ALI mice.",2023,12,26
Classification of light Yorkshire pigs at different production stages using ordinary least squares and machine learning methods.,"Pig homogeneity and growth are major concerns for the pig industry today. Variability in pigs' size has a strong impact on profitability as uniformity plays a key role in the overall economic value of pigs produced. This research focused on statistical methods to identify pigs at risk of growth retardation at different stages of production. Data from 125 083 Yorkshire pigs at weaning (18-28 d), 59 533 pigs at the end of the nursery period (70-82 d) and 48 862 pigs at slaughter (155-170 d) were analyzed under three different cut-points (lowest 10, 20 and 30%) to characterize light animals. Records were randomly split into 2:1 training:testing sets, and each training data set was analyzed through an ordinary least squares approach and four machine learning algorithms (decision tree, random forest, and two alternative boosting approaches). A wide range of weighting functions were applied to give increased relevance to lighter pigs. Each resulting classification norm was used to classify light pigs in the testing data set. Both sensitivity and specificity were retained to construct the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the statistical performance of each analytical approach was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC). In all production stages and cut-points, the random forest machine learning algorithm provided the highest AUC, closely followed by boosting procedures. For weaning BW (WW), factors related to birth BW and litter size accounted for more than 75% of the important prediction factors for light pigs. BW at the end of the nursery period and slaughter BW analyses revealed a similar pattern where WW and BW at the end of the nursery period accounted for more than 40 and 50% of statistical importance among the prediction factors, respectively. Machine learning algorithms are useful tools to easily evaluate the risk factors affecting the efficiency and homogeneity in swine. Since the BW at birth and weaning are key factors, sow nutrition and feeding management during gestation and lactation, along with piglet management during lactation, are identified as important influences on pig weight variability.",2023,12,05
The impact of tetrachlorobisphenol A exposure during puberty: Altered Leydig cell development and induced endoplasmic reticulum stress in male mice.,"Tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA), a halogenated flame retardant and endocrine disruptor, has been detected in human urine and serum. While previous research has shown its impact on the reproductive system, investigations into its mechanisms during puberty remain limited. This study aims to explore the effects of TCBPA on Leydig cells in adolescent mice and potential underlying mechanisms. Male C57 mice of age 28 days were gavaged with 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day for 28 days. TCBPA did not alter body weight and testis weight but lowered testosterone levels at 100 and 200 mg/kg and reduced sperm count in the epididymis at 200 mg/kg. TCBPA lowered Leydig cell number at 200 mg/kg while it downregulated key Leydig cell gene (Lhcgr, Scarb1, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Hsd3b6, Hsd17b3 and Insl3) as low as 50 mg/kg. Further study indicated that TCBPA induced reactive oxygen species and caused endoplasmic reticulum stress. In vitro study in TM3 mouse Leydig cells showed that TCBPA indeed induced reactive oxygen species and caused endoplasmic reticulum stress at 75 μM and inhibited testosterone production at this concentration and addition of antioxidant tocopherol can reverse it. These discoveries provide new insights and references for a deeper understanding of the toxic mechanisms of TCBPA on Leydig cells during puberty.",2023,12,29
Non-covalent binding of chlorogenic acid to myofibrillar protein improved its bio-functionality properties and metabolic fate.,"As natural antioxidants added to meat products, polyphenols can interact with proteins, and the acid-base environment influenced the extent of non-covalent and covalent interactions between them. This study compared the bio-functional characteristics and metabolic outcomes of the myofibrillar protein-chlorogenic acid (MP-CGA) complexes binding in different environments (pH 6.0 and 8.5). The results showed that CGA bound with MP significantly enhanced its antioxidant activity and inhibitory effect on metabolism enzymes. CGA bound deeply into the MP structure hydrophobic cavity at pH 6.0, which reduced its degradation by digestive enzymes, thus increasing its bio-accessibility from 59.5% to 71.6%. The digestion products of the two complexes exhibited significant differences, with the non-covalent MP-CGA complexes formed at pH 6.0 showing significantly higher concentrations of rhetsinine and piplartine, two well-known compounds to modulate diabetes. This study demonstrated that non-covalent binding between protein and polyphenol in the acidic environment held greater promising prospects for improving health.",2023,12,15
"Polyvinyl alcohol films incorporated with clove essential oil emulsions stabilized by soy protein isolate-derived amyloid fibrils: Fabrication, characterization, and its application for active packaging.","This study aimed to prepare a novel emulsion film with high stability, using soy protein-derived amyloid fibrils (SAFs) as an emulsifier incorporating clove essential oil (CEO) as the active component, and the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix to stabilize the system. The results demonstrated that SAFs can successfully stabilize CEO. Emulsion prepared by SAF<sub>S</sub> and CEO (SAC) exhibited a small droplet size and better dispersibility compared with SPI and CEO (SC) emulsion. According to FT-IR results, PVA addition increased the hydrogen bond interactions among emulsion film components, thus further reinforcing the protein matrix, increasing the tensile strength (TS) (41.18 MPa) and elongation at break (E) (121.62 %) of the films. The uniform appearance of SAC-PVA (SACP) emulsion films was confirmed by SEM images. Furthermore, SACP emulsion films show distinctive barrier properties, optical properties, and outstanding antioxidant properties. Finally, emulsion films exhibited excellent preservation of strawberries, resulting in an effective decline of the decay rate.",2023,12,22
Dry-heat-induced phosphoserine-specific fragmentation of ovalbumin.,"When subjected to dry-heating, egg white ovalbumin, a phosphoglycoprotein, undergoes fragmentation and forms soluble aggregates. We investigated the mechanisms of dry-heat-induced fragmentation of ovalbumin. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that ovalbumin fragmented into five polypeptides, and their amount increased over 6 h of dry-heat treatment at 120 °C. The fragments contained fewer or no phosphoserine, compared with that in crude ovalbumin. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic digests revealed that the fragmentation sites were located on phosphoserine residues, S<sup>68</sup> and S<sup>344</sup>. During fragmentation, the phosphoserine residues underwent conversion into dehydroalanine residues, which were subsequently hydrolyzed. The nitrogen from the dehydroalanine became a newly formed terminal amide group on the N-terminal fragment, while the remaining molecule predominantly formed a new terminal pyruvoyl group. Furthermore, the fragments were incorporated into monomers or soluble aggregates of ovalbumin via covalent and non-covalent bonds. This study demonstrated a novel mechanism for dry-heat-induced fragmentation of phosphoproteins.",2023,12,27
Enzymatic debittering of cheese flavoring and bitterness characterization of peptide mixture using sensory and peptidomics approach.,"Peptides in cheese flavoring produced through proteolysis plus fermentation generated bitterness. Bitterness of individual peptide can be quantified using quantitative structure-activity relationship, where molecular mass (M), hydrophobicity, residues, C-terminal hydrophobic amino acids (C-HAAs), and N-terminal basic ones (N-BAAs) are crucial. However, their accumulative influence on the overall bitterness of peptide mixture remains unknown. This study delved into extensive proteolysis to debitter and to correlate the multi-influencing factors of peptides and the collective bitterness. As hydrolysis increased from 7.5 % to 28.0 %, bitterness reduced from 5.0 to 0.3-2.7 scores, contingent on proteases used, in which FU was optimal. The overall bitterness cannot be predicted through the summation of individual peptide bitterness, which depended on M (0.5-3 kDa) and 5-23 residues, followed by N-BAAs and C-HAAs. Analysis of enzymatic cleavage sites and substrate characteristics revealed, to more effectively debitter bovine milk protein hydrolysates, proteases specifically cleaving Pro, Leu, Phe, and Val were desired.",2023,12,17
Alternating direction method of multipliers for displacement estimation in ultrasound strain elastography.,"Ultrasound strain imaging, which delineates mechanical properties to detect tissue abnormalities, involves estimating the time delay between two radio-frequency (RF) frames collected before and after tissue deformation. The existing regularized optimization-based time-delay estimation (TDE) techniques suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (1) The regularizer is not aligned with the tissue deformation physics due to taking only the first-order displacement derivative into account; (2) The L2-norm of the displacement derivatives, which oversmooths the estimated time-delay, is utilized as the regularizer; (3) The modulus function defined mathematically should be approximated by a smooth function to facilitate the optimization of L1-norm.",2023,12,30
"Pinuseldarone, a Clerodane-Type Diterpene from <i>Pinus eldarica</i> Needles and Phytochemicals as Novel Agents for Regulating Brown Adipogenesis and Thermogenesis.","Phytochemical investigation of the MeOH extract of <i>Pinus eldarica</i> needles led to the isolation and identification of a new clerodane-type diterpene, pinuseldarone (<b>1</b>), along with a known flavonoid, 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7,8-trimethoxy-6-C-methylflavone (<b>2</b>), through HPLC purification. The structure of the new compound <b>1</b> was elucidated using spectroscopic methods, including 1D and 2D NMR, as well as HRESIMS. Its absolute configuration was established through NOESY analysis and computational methods, including electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations and gauge-including atomic orbital NMR chemical shift calculations, followed by DP4+ probability analysis. The metabolic implications of the isolated compounds were assessed using a cultured brown adipocyte model derived from murine brown adipose tissue. It was observed that treatment with dihydroxy-3,7,8-trimethoxy-6-C-methylflavone (<b>2</b>) downregulates the adipogenic marker C/EBPδ and fatty acid transporter CD36, resulting in a significant reduction in lipid accumulation during brown adipocyte differentiation. However, pinuseldarone (<b>1</b>) treatment did not affect brown adipocyte differentiation. Interestingly, pretreatment with pinuseldarone (<b>1</b>) potentiated the pharmacological stimulation of brown adipocytes, seemingly achieved by sensitizing their response to β3-adrenoreceptor signaling. Therefore, our findings indicate that phytochemicals derived from <i>P. eldarica</i> needles could potentially serve as valuable compounds for adjusting the metabolic activity of brown adipose tissue, a vital component in maintaining whole-body metabolic homeostasis.",2023,12,30
Regioselective Ring-Opening of Terminal Epoxides Catalyzed by a Porous Metal Silicate Material.,"Reductive ring-opening of epoxides is a green pathway for synthesizing highly value-added alcohols. In this study, we present a practically applicable approach for the synthesis of anti-Markovnikov-type alcohols with high yields from aliphatic and aromatic epoxides under mild conditions by developing porous metal silicate (PMS) catalysts. A PMS material PMS-20 consists of cobalt and nickel bimetal redox-active sites, exhibiting exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity in the reductive ring-opening of terminal epoxides with >99% yield of primary alcohols. Comparing with the existing methods using noble metals, PMS-20 exhibits broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance by synergistic work between cobalt and nickel species, which is clarified by dual chamber cell system characterization and theoretical calculation results.",2023,12,30
Benzenepoly(carboxylic acid)s as Exclusive Intrinsic Markers to Assess Riverine Export of Dissolved Black Carbon.,"Landscape fires annually generate large quantities of black carbon. The water-soluble fraction of black carbon (i.e., dissolved black carbon/DBC) is an important constituent of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool, playing a crucial role in the global budget of refractory carbon and climate change. A key challenge in constraining the flux and fate of riverine DBC is to develop targeted and accurate quantification methods. Herein, we report that benzenepentacarboxylic acid (B5CA) intrinsically present in DBC can be used as an exclusive and holistic marker (representing both condensed aromatics and less-/nonaromatic fractions) for DBC quantification. B5CA was universally detected in water extractions of biochar and fire-affected soils with relatively large abundance but not produced by nonthermogenic processes. It has good mobility in the environment as it is not readily precipitated by cations or adsorbed by common geosorbents. B5CA also represents the recalcitrant components of DBC with excellent stability against photodegradation and biodegradation. Applying B5CA as the DBC marker in surface waters of the Changjiang River (i.e., the third largest river in the world), we calculate the DBC concentration in the downstream Changjiang River to be 4.8 ± 5.5% of the DOC flux. Our work provides a simple and reliable approach for the accurate quantification and source tracking of DBC in the soil and aquatic carbon pools.",2023,12,30
Exploration of the Parameter Space of an Ion Channel Kinetic Model by a Markov-Chain-Based Methodology.,"In this work, we propose a methodology based on Monte Carlo Markov chains to explore the parameter space of kinetic models for ion channels. The methodology allows the detection of potential parameter sets of a model that are compatible with experimentally obtained whole-cell currents, which could remain hidden when methods focus on obtaining the parameters that provide the best fit. To show its implementation and utility, we considered a four-state kinetic model proposed in the literature to describe the activation of the voltage-gated proton channel (Hv1), <i>Biophysical Journal,</i> <b>2014</b>, <i>107</i>, 1564. In that work, a set of values for the rate transitions that describe the channel kinetics at different intracellular H<sup>+</sup> concentration (pH<sub>i</sub>) were obtained by the Simplex method. With our approach, we find that, in fact, there is more than one parameter set for each pH<sub>i</sub>, which renders the same open probability temporal course within the experimental error margin for all of the considered voltages. The large differences that we obtained for the values of some rate constants among the different solutions show that there is more than one possible interpretation of this channel behavior as a function of pH<sub>i</sub>. We also simulated a proposed new experimental condition where it is possible to observe that different sets of parameters yield different results. Our study highlights the importance of a comprehensive analysis of parameter space in kinetic models and the utility of the proposed methodology for finding potential solutions.",2023,12,30
ATM-deficiency-induced microglial activation promotes neurodegeneration in ataxia-telangiectasia.,"While ATM loss of function has long been identified as the genetic cause of ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), how it leads to selective and progressive degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons remains unclear. ATM expression is enriched in microglia throughout cerebellar development and adulthood. Here, we find evidence of microglial inflammation in the cerebellum of patients with A-T using single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Pseudotime analysis revealed that activation of A-T microglia preceded upregulation of apoptosis-related genes in granule and Purkinje neurons and that microglia exhibited increased neurotoxic cytokine signaling to granule and Purkinje neurons in A-T. To confirm these findings experimentally, we performed transcriptomic profiling of A-T induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia, which revealed cell-intrinsic microglial activation of cytokine production and innate immune response pathways compared to controls. Furthermore, A-T microglia co-culture with either control or A-T iPSC-derived neurons was sufficient to induce cytotoxicity. Taken together, these studies reveal that cell-intrinsic microglial activation may promote neurodegeneration in A-T.",2023,12,28

Umbrella review and Delphi study on modifiable factors for dementia risk reduction.,"A 2013 systematic review and Delphi consensus study identified 12 modifiable risk and protective factors for dementia, which were subsequently merged into the ""LIfestyle for BRAin health"" (LIBRA) score. We systematically evaluated whether LIBRA requires revision based on new evidence. To identify modifiable risk and protective factors suitable for dementia risk reduction, we combined an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses with a two-round Delphi consensus study. The review of 608 unique primary studies and opinions of 18 experts prioritized six modifiable factors: hearing impairment, social contact, sleep, life course inequalities, atrial fibrillation, and psychological stress. Based on expert ranking, hearing impairment, social contact, and sleep were considered the most suitable candidates for inclusion in updated dementia risk scores. As such, the current study shows that dementia risk scores need systematic updates based on emerging evidence. Future studies will validate the updated LIBRA score in different cohorts. HIGHLIGHTS: An umbrella review was combined with opinions of 18 dementia experts. Various candidate targets for dementia risk reduction were identified. Experts prioritized hearing impairment, social contact, and sleep. Re-assessment of dementia risk scores is encouraged. Future work should evaluate the predictive validity of updated risk scores.",2023,12,30
Prognostic significance and immunological role of HPRT1 in human cancers.,"Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 (HPRT1), once considered a housekeeping gene, has been identified as playing an important role in several tumors. Its role in pan-cancer, however, has not been systematically studied. This study evaluates the relationship between HPRT1 and clinical parameters, survival prognosis, and tumor immunity based on multi omics data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Drug sensitivity analysis screened 16 effective drugs against HPRT1, exploring the interactions with chemicals and genes. The significance of HPRT1 in tumor immunotherapy has also been investigated. Immunohistochemistry confirmed significant differences in the expression of HPRT1 between five tumor types (colon adenocarcinoma [COAD], head-neck squamous cell carcinoma [HNSC], lung adenocarcinoma [LUAD], thyroid carcinoma [THCA], and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma [UCEC]) and adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.05). HPRT1 competitive endogenous RNA network was constructed in HNSC. Through cytological experiments, it was verified that HPRT1 plays a carcinogenic role in HNSC and is associated with tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between HPRT1 and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) expression in HNSC (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that HPRT1 may be a potential biomarker for predicting and treating cancer.",2023,12,14
ISX-9 Promotes KGF Secretion From MSCs to Alleviate ALI Through NGFR-ERK-TAU-β-Catenin Signaling Axis.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely studied to alleviate acute lung injury (ALI) due to their paracrine function. However, the microenvironment of inflammatory outbreaks significantly restricted the factors secreted from MSCs like keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). KGF is a growth factor with tissue-repaired ability. Is there a better therapeutic prospect for MSCs in combination with compounds that promote their paracrine function? Through compound screening, we screened out isoxazole-9 (ISX-9) to promote MSCs derived KGF secretion and investigated the underlying mechanisms of action.",2023,12,30

Multi-energy CT material decomposition using graph model improved CNN.,"In spectral CT imaging, the coefficient image of the basis material obtained by the material decomposition technique can estimate the tissue composition, and its accuracy directly affects the disease diagnosis. Although the precision of material decomposition is increased by employing convolutional neural networks (CNN), extracting the non-local features from the CT image is restricted using the traditional CNN convolution operator. A graph model built by multi-scale non-local self-similar patterns is introduced into multi-material decomposition (MMD). We proposed a novel MMD method based on graph edge-conditioned convolution U-net (GECCU-net) to enhance material image quality. The GECCU-net focuses on developing a multi-scale encoder. At the network coding stage, three paths are applied to capture comprehensive image features. The local and non-local feature aggregation (LNFA) blocks are designed to integrate the local and non-local features from different paths. The graph edge-conditioned convolution based on non-Euclidean space excavates the non-local features. A hybrid loss function is defined to accommodate multi-scale input images and avoid over-smoothing of results. The proposed network is compared quantitatively with base CNN models on the simulated and real datasets. The material images generated by GECCU-net have less noise and artifacts while retaining more information on tissue. The Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) of the obtained abdomen and chest water maps reaches 0.9976 and 0.9990, respectively, and the RMSE reduces to 0.1218 and 0.4903 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The proposed method can improve MMD performance and has potential applications.",2023,12,30
Pressure and Skin: A Review of Disease Entities Driven or Influenced by Mechanical Pressure.,"Skin perceives and reacts to external mechanical forces to create resistance against the external environment. Excessive or inappropriate stimuli of pressure may lead to cellular alterations of the skin and the development of both benign and malignant skin disorders. We conducted a comprehensive literature review to delve into the pressure-induced and aggravated skin disorders and their underlying pressure-related mechanisms. Dysregulated mechanical responses of the skin give rise to local inflammation, ischemia, necrosis, proliferation, hyperkeratosis, impaired regeneration, atrophy, or other injurious reactions, resulting in various disease entities. The use of personal devices, activities, occupations, weight bearing, and even unintentional object contact and postures are potential scenarios that account for the development of pressure-related skin disorders. The spectrum of these skin disorders may involve the epidermis (keratinocytes and melanocytes), hair follicles, eccrine glands, nail apparatuses, dermis (fibroblasts, mast cells, and vasculature), subcutis, and fascia. Clarifying the clinical context of each patient and recognizing how pressure at the cellular and tissue levels leads to skin lesions can enhance our comprehension of pressure-related skin disorders to attain better management.",2023,12,30

The impact of climate change and human activities on the change in the net primary productivity of vegetation-taking Sichuan Province as an example.,"Vegetation is an essential component of terrestrial ecosystems, influenced by climate change and human activities. Quantifying the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to vegetation dynamics is crucial for addressing global climate change. Sichuan Province is one of the essential ecological functional areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and its vegetation change is of great significance to the environmental function and ecological security of the Yangtze River Basin and southwest China. In this paper, the modified Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach(CASA) model was used to estimate the monthly NPP (Net Primary Productivity) of vegetation in Sichuan Province from 2000 to 2018, and the univariate linear regression analysis was used to analyze the temporal and spatial variation of vegetation NPP in Sichuan Province from 2000 to 2018. In addition, taking vegetation NPP as an index, Pearson correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, and second-order partial correlation analysis were carried out to quantitatively analyze the contribution of climate change and human activities to vegetation NPP. Finally, the Hurst index and nonparametric Man-Kendall significance test were used to predict the future change trend of vegetation NPP in Sichuan Province. The results show that (1) from 2000 to 2018, the NPP of vegetation in Sichuan Province has a significant increasing trend (Slope = 6.09gC·m<sup>-2</sup>·a<sup>-1</sup>), with a multi-year average of 438.72 gC·m<sup>-2</sup>·a<sup>-1</sup>, showing a trend of low in the east and high in the middle. The response of vegetation NPP to altitude is different at different elevations; (2) the contribution rates of climate change and human activities to vegetation NPP change are 4.12gC·m<sup>-2</sup>·a<sup>-1</sup> and 1.97gC·m<sup>-2</sup>·a<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. In contrast, the impact of human activities on NPP is more significant than climate change. Human activities are the main factors affecting vegetation restoration and degradation in Sichuan Province. However, the positive contribution to NPP change is less than climate change; (3) the future vegetation NPP change trend in Sichuan Province is mainly rising, and the same direction change trend is much larger than the reverse change trend. The areas with an increasing trend in the future account for 89.187% of the total area. This research helps understand the impact of climate change and human activities on vegetation change in Sichuan Province. It offers scientific bases for vegetation restoration and ecosystem management in Sichuan and the surrounding areas.",2023,12,30
Multiple gene-drug prediction tool reveals Rosiglitazone based treatment pathway for non-segmental vitiligo.,"Vitiligo is a skin disease characterized by selective loss of melanocytes, which seriously affects the appearance and causes great psychological stress to patients. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of two vitiligo microarray datasets from the GEO database using bioinformatics tools to identify 297 up-regulated mRNAs and 186 down-regulated mRNAs, revealing important roles for pathways related to melanin synthesis, tyrosine metabolism, and inflammatory factors, such as ""PPAR signaling pathway"", ""tyrosine metabolism"", ""nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathway"", ""melanogenesis"", and ""IL-17 signaling pathway"". Combining the Search Tool for Interacting Chemicals (STITCH) database 5.0 and the drug-gene interaction database 3.0 (DGIdb), we identified that the PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone may promote melanin synthesis via EDNRB. Next, we investigated the mechanism of rosiglitazone and PPAR-γ pathway in promoting melanin production. Consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis, the expression levels of PPAR-γ, EDNRB, and TYR were significantly reduced in human non-segmental vitiligo skin along with the reduction of MITF, a key gene for epidermal melanogenesis. Meanwhile, rosiglitazone increased melanin synthesis capacity in melanocytes and zebrafish by activating PPAR-γ and upregulating TYR, TYRP-1, and TYRP-2. Conversely, treatment of melanocytes with the PPAR-γ antagonist GW resulted in inhibition of melanin synthesis and expression of melanin-related factors. At the same time, simultaneous treatment of rosiglitazone with GW reversed the inhibitory effect of GW on melanin synthesis. In this study, we identified that rosiglitazone, an important insulin sensitizer, promotes melanin synthesis in melanocytes by increasing PPAR-γ activity and upregulating the expression levels of EDNRB and TYR. These findings may provide new ideas for exploring the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets of non-segmental vitiligo.",2023,12,30

CTSB Nuclear Translocation Facilitates DNA Damage and Lysosomal Stress to Promote Retinoblastoma Cell Death.,"Retinoblastoma (RB) is a pernicious tumor originating from photoreceptor precursor cells that often endangers the lives of children. The purpose of our study was to further investigate the influence of cathepsin B (CTSB) nuclear translocation on RB cell death. Y79 cells were injected into the vitreous cavity of nude mice at a dose of 4 µL/mouse to establish an animal model of RB. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Western blot analysis, a comet assay, a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry were used to measure the levels of the interrelated genes and proteins and to evaluate alterations in autophagy, apoptosis, proliferation, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. CTSB was found to be expressed at low levels in RB animal model samples and RB cell lines. Functionally, CTSB nuclear translocation promoted DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, ferroptosis and autophagy in Y79 cells and inhibited their proliferation. Downstream mechanistic studies showed that nuclear translocation of CTSB facilitates DNA damage and cell cycle arrest in RB cells by inhibiting breast cancer 1 protein (BRCA1) expression and also activates the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1 (STAT3/STING1) pathway to induce lysosomal stress, leading to ferroptosis and autophagy in Y79 cells and alleviating RB. Nuclear translocation of CTSB facilitates DNA damage and cell cycle arrest in RB cells by inhibiting BRCA1 expression and activating the STAT3/STING1 pathway and induces lysosomal stress, which eventually leads to ferroptosis and autophagy and mitigates RB.",2023,12,30

Development of competitive and noncompetitive lateral flow immunoassays for pendimethalin using synthetic peptides.,"Peptidomimetic and anti-immunocomplex peptides can be easily isolated from phage display libraries, and can be used as alternatives to chemical competing haptens to improve the sensitivity of small molecule immunoassay. In this work, 16 peptidomimetics and 7 anti-immunocomplex peptides of pendimethalin (PND) were obtained from cyclic 7-, 8-, 9-, and 10-residue peptide phage libraries. Peptidomimetic EJ-2 (CMFTGTDFPC) with the highest sensitivity in competitive phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunocomplex peptide EF-30 (CNPGWPPIPC) with the highest sensitivity in noncompetitive phage ELISA were selected to prepare phage-free peptides with GGGSSK-biotin at the C-terminus. Competitive and noncompetitive lateral flow immunoassays (CLFIA and NLFIA) were developed by using the phage-free peptides. After optimization, the CLFIA and NLFIA showed visual limit of detections (vLODs) of 5 ng/mL and 2.5 ng/mL, respectively, which were improved two- and fourfold compared with a LFIA based on chemical hapten. The NLFIA showed better sensitivity than CLFIA in the detection of spiked samples, and can meet the detection requirements for agro-products regulated by EU and China. The detection results of CLFIA and NLFIA for blind samples were consistent with that of ultra performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.",2023,12,30

Suboptimal Weight Loss 13 Years After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Is Associated with Blunted Appetite Response.,"Bariatric surgery remains the most efficient treatment to achieve a sustained weight loss. However, a large proportion of patients experience suboptimal weight loss (SWL). The exact mechanisms involved remain to be fully elucidated, but the homeostatic appetite control system seems to be involved. The aim of this study was, therefore, to compare the plasma concentration of gastrointestinal hormones, and appetite ratings, between those experiencing SWL and optimal weight loss (OWL) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).",2023,12,30
Challenges and pitfalls in classification of disproportionate mitral regurgitation.,"The concept of disproportionate mitral regurgitation (dispropMR) has been introduced to identify patients with functional mitral regurgitation (MR) who benefit from percutaneous treatment. We aimed to examine echocardiographic characteristics behind this entity. We retrospectively included 172 consecutive patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and more than mild MR referred to clinically indicated echocardiography. According to the proportionality ratio (effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA)/left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV)) patients were divided into dispropMR and proportionate MR (propMR) group. Potential factors which might affect proportionality definition were analyzed. 55 patients (32%) had dispropMR. Discrepant grading of MR severity was observed when using regurgitant volume (RegVol) by proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method or volumetric method, with significant discordance only in dispropMR (p < 0.001). Patients with dispropMR had more frequently left ventricular foreshortened images for LVEDV calculation than patients with propMR (p = 0.003), resulting in smaller LVEDV in dispropMR group. DispropMR group had more substantial dynamic variation of regurgitant flow compared to propMR. Accordingly, EROA was consistently overestimated by standard single-point PISA method compared to serial PISA method. This was more pronounced in dispropMR (bias:10.5 ± 28.3 mm<sup>2</sup>) compared to propMR group (bias:6.4 ± 12.8 mm<sup>2</sup>). DispropMR may be found in roughly one third of clinically indicated echocardiographic studies in patients with reduced LVEF and more than mild MR. EROA overestimation due to dynamic variation of regurgitant flow and LVEDV underestimation due to LV foreshortening were more frequently found in dispropMR. Our results indicate that methodological limitations of echocardiographic MR grading could not be neglected in classifying the proportionality of MR.",2023,12,30
A dual-functional cuprum coordination framework for high proton conduction and electrochemical dopamine detection.,"The present study selected 5, 5'-((6-(ethylamino)-1, 3, 5-triazine-2, 4-diyl) bis(azanediyl))diisophthalic acid (H<sub>4</sub>EATDIA) as ligand and an amino-functionalized cuprum-based MOF (EA-JUC-1000), successfully synthesized by microwave-assisted method, for proton conduction and dopamine sensing applications. In order to enhance the proton-conducting potential of EA-JUC-1000, the Brönsted acid (BA) encapsulated composites (BA@EA-JUC-1000) are dopped into chitosan (CS) to form a series of hybrid membranes (BA@EA-JUC-1000/CS). The impedance results display that the best proton conductivity of CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H@EA-JUC-1000/CS-8% reaches up to 1.23 × 10<sup>-3</sup> S∙cm<sup>-1</sup> at 338 K and ~ 98% RH, 2.6-fold than that of CS. Moreover, the EA-JUC-1000 is in-situ combined with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (rGO/EA-JUC-1000), which makes EA-JUC-1000 have a wide detection range (0.1 ~ 500 μM) and a low limit of detection (50 nM), together with good anti-interference performance, reproducibility and repeatability. In addition, the electrochemical sensing method has been successfully applied to detect DA in bovine serum samples. The dual-functional MOF-based hybrid membrane and composites including proton conduction and DA sensing would provide an example of practical application for MOFs.",2023,12,30
An Egalitarian Perspective on Information Sharing: The Example of Health Care Priorities.,"In health care, the provision of pertinent information to patients is not just a moral imperative but also a legal obligation, often articulated through the lens of obtaining informed consent. Codes of medical ethics and many national laws mandate the disclosure of basic information about diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment alternatives. However, within publicly funded health care systems, other kinds of information might also be important to patients, such as insights into the health care priorities that underlie treatment offers made. While conventional perspectives do not take this as an obligatory part of the information to be shared with patients, perhaps through viewing it as clinically ""non-actionable,"" we advocate for a paradigm shift. Our proposition diverges from the traditional emphasis on actionability. We contend that honoring patients as equal moral agents necessitates, among other principles, a commitment to honesty. Withholding specific categories of information pertinent to patients' comprehension of their situation is inherently incompatible with this principle. In this article, we advocate for a recalibration of the burden of proof. Rather than requiring special justifications for adding to the standard set of information items, we suggest that physicians should be able to justify excluding relevant facts about the patient's situation and the underlying considerations shaping health care professionals' choices. This perspective prioritizes transparency and empowers patients with a comprehensive understanding, aligning with the ethos of respect for the patient as person.",2023,12,30
Phage cocktail alleviated type 2 diabetes by reshaping gut microbiota and decreasing proinflammatory cytokines.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a global health concern, is closely associated with the gut microbiota. Restoration of a balanced microbiota and intestinal homeostasis benefit therapy of T2D. Some special phages may selectively alter the gut microbiota without causing dysbiosis, such as MS2 and P22. However, scarcely systematic analysis of cascading effects triggered by MS2 and P22 phages on the microbiota, as well as interactions between specific gut bacteria and systemic metabolism, seriously inhibit the development of positive interventions of phages. Based on multi-omic analysis, we analyzed the intrinsic correlations among specific microbiota, their bioactive metabolites, and key indicators of T2D. We found that gavage of the MS2-P22 phage cocktail could significantly alter the gut microbiome to attenuate dysbiosis of diabetic C57BL/6 mice caused by high-fat diets (HFDs) and streptozotocin (STZ), by affecting microbial compositions as well as their metabolic pathways and metabolites, especially increasing amounts of short-chain fatty acid-producing (SCFA-producing) bacteria (e.g., Blautia and Romboutsia) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Correspondingly, a noteworthy reduction in the number of several opportunistic pathogens occurred, e.g., Candidatus Saccharimonas, Aerococcus, Oscillibacter, Desulfovibrio, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1. Synchronously, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were reduced to recover gut barrier function in T2D mice. These findings might benefit the development of a new dietary intervention for T2D based on phage cocktails. KEY POINTS: • Intestinal barrier integrity of T2D mice is improved by a phage cocktail • Negative relationship between Muribaculaceae and Corynebacterium reshaped gut microbiota • Acetate, propionate, and butyrate decreased the level of proinflammatory factors.",2023,12,30
The horizontal gene transfer of perchlorate reduction genomic island in three bacteria from an ecological niche.,"Three new strains of dissimilatory perchlorate-reducing bacteria (DPRB), QD19-16, QD1-5, and P3-1, were isolated from an active sludge. Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA genes indicated that QD19-16, QD1-5, and P3-1 belonged to Brucella, Acidovorax, and Citrobacter, respectively, expanding the distribution of DPRB in the Proteobacteria. The three strains were gram-negative and facultative anaerobes with rod-shaped cells without flagella, which were 1.0-1.6 μm long and 0.5-0.6 μm wide. The three DPRB strains utilized similar broad spectrum of electron donors and acceptors and demonstrated a similar capability to reduce perchlorate within 6 days. The enzyme activity of perchlorate reductase in QD19-16 toward chlorate was higher than that toward perchlorate. The high sequence similarity of the perchlorate reductase operon and chlorite dismutase genes in the perchlorate reduction genomic islands (PRI) of the three strains implied that they were monophyletic origin from a common ancestral PRI. Two transposase genes (tnp1 and tnp2) were found in the PRIs of strain QD19-16 and QD1-5, but were absent in the strain P3-1 PRI. The presence of fragments of IR sequences in the P3-1 PRI suggested that P3-1 PRI had previously contained these two tnp genes. Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that a common ancestral PRI transferred across the strains Brucella sp. QD19-16, Acidovorax sp. QD1-5, and Citrobacter sp. P3-1 through horizontal gene transfer, facilitated by transposases. These results provided a direct evidence of horizontal gene transfer of PRI that could jump across phylogenetically unrelated bacteria through transposase. KEY POINTS: • Three new DPRB strains can effectively remove high concentration of perchlorate. • The PRIs of three DPRB strains are acquired from a single ancestral PRI. • PRIs are incorporated into different bacteria genome through HGT by transposase.",2023,12,30
Motility of Acinetobacter baumannii: regulatory systems and controlling strategies.,"Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative opportunistic zoonotic pathogenic bacterium that causes nosocomial infections ranging from minor to life-threatening. The clinical importance of this zoonotic pathogen is rapidly increasing due to the development of multiple resistance mechanisms and the synthesis of numerous virulence factors. Although no flagellum-mediated motility exists, it may move through twitching or surface-associated motility. Twitching motility is a coordinated multicellular movement caused by the extension, attachment, and retraction of type IV pili, which are involved in surface adherence and biofilm formation. Surface-associated motility is a kind of movement that does not need appendages and is most likely driven by the release of extra polymeric molecules. This kind of motility is linked to the production of 1,3-diaminopropane, lipooligosaccharide formation, natural competence, and efflux pump proteins. Since A. baumannii's virulence qualities are directly tied to motility, it is possible that its motility may be used as a specialized preventative or therapeutic measure. The current review detailed the signaling mechanism and involvement of various proteins in controlling A. baumannii motility. As a result, we have thoroughly addressed the role of natural and synthetic compounds that impede A. baumannii motility, as well as the underlying action mechanisms. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms behind A. baumannii's motility features will aid in the development of therapeutic drugs to control its infection. KEY POINTS: • Acinetobacter baumannii exhibits multiple resistance mechanisms. • A. baumannii can move owing to twitching and surface-associated motility. • Natural and synthetic compounds can attenuate A. baumannii motility.",2023,12,30
The effects of CypA on apoptosis: potential target for the treatment of diseases.,"Cyclophilin A (CypA), the first member of cyclophilins, is distributed extensively in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, primarily localized in the cytoplasm. In addition to acting as an intracellular receptor for cyclosporin A (CSA), CypA plays a crucial role in diseases such as aging and tumorigenesis. Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is able to balance the rate of cell viability and death. In this review, we focus on the effects of CypA on apoptosis and the relationship between specific mechanisms of CypA promoting or inhibiting apoptosis and diseases, including tumorigenesis, cardiovascular diseases, organ injury, and microbial infections. Notably, the process of CypA promoting or inhibiting apoptosis is closely related to disease development. Finally, future prospects for the association of CypA and apoptosis are discussed, and a comprehensive understanding of the effects of CypA on apoptosis in relation to diseases is expected to provide new insights into the design of CypA as a therapeutic target for diseases. KEY POINTS: • Understand the effect of CypA on apoptosis. • CypA affects apoptosis through specific pathways. • The effect of CypA on apoptosis is associated with a variety of disease processes.",2023,12,30
Genes controlling hydrolysate toxin tolerance identified by QTL analysis of the natural Saccharomyces cerevisiae BCC39850.,"Lignocellulosic material can be converted to valorized products such as fuels. Pretreatment is an essential step in conversion, which is needed to increase the digestibility of the raw material for microbial fermentation. However, pretreatment generates by-products (hydrolysate toxins) that are detrimental to microbial growth. In this study, natural Saccharomyces strains isolated from habitats in Thailand were screened for their tolerance to synthetic hydrolysate toxins (synHTs). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae natural strain BCC39850 (toxin-tolerant) was crossed with the laboratory strain CEN.PK2-1C (toxin-sensitive), and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed on the segregants using phenotypic scores of growth (OD<sub>600</sub>) and glucose consumption. VMS1, DET1, KCS1, MRH1, YOS9, SYO1, and YDR042C were identified from QTLs as candidate genes associated with the tolerance trait. CEN.PK2-1C knockouts of the VMS1, YOS9, KCS1, and MRH1 genes exhibited significantly greater hydrolysate toxin sensitivity to growth, whereas CEN.PK2-1C knock-ins with replacement of VMS1 and MRH1 genes from the BCC39850 alleles showed significant increased ethanol production titers compared with the CEN.PK2-1C parental strain in the presence of synHTs. The discovery of VMS1, YOS9, MRH1, and KCS1 genes associated with hydrolysate toxin tolerance in S. cerevisiae indicates the roles of the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation pathway, plasma membrane protein association, and the phosphatidylinositol signaling system in this trait. KEY POINTS: • QTL analysis was conducted using a hydrolysate toxin-tolerant S. cerevisiae natural strain • Deletion of VMS1, YOS9, MRH1, and KCS1 genes associated with hydrolysate toxin-sensitivity • Replacement of VMS1 and MRH1 with natural strain alleles increased ethanol production titers in the presence of hydrolysate toxins.",2023,12,30

"Stem growth phenology, not canopy greening constrains deciduous tree growth.","Canopy phenology is a widely used proxy for deciduous forest growth with various applications in terrestrial ecosystem modeling. Its use relies on common assumptions that canopy greening and stem growth are tightly coordinated processes, enabling predictions on the timing and the quantity of annual tree growth. Here, we present parallel observations of canopy and stem growth phenology and annual stem increment in around 90 deciduous forest trees with diffuse-porous (Fagus sylvatica, Acer pseudoplatanus, Carpinus betulus) or ring-porous (Quercus robur x petraea) wood anatomy. These data were collected in a mixed temperate forest at the Swiss-Canopy-Crane II site, in four years with strongly contrasting weather conditions. We found that stem growth resumption lagged several weeks behind spring canopy greening in diffuse-porous but not in ring-porous trees. Canopy greening and stem growth resumption showed no or only weak signs of temporal coordination across the observation years. Within the assessed species, the seasonal timing of stem growth varied strongly among individuals, as trees with high annual increments resumed growth earlier and also completed their main growth earlier. The length of main growth activity had no influence on annual increments. Our findings do not only challenge tight temporal coordination of canopy and stem growth phenology but also demonstrate that longer main growth activity does not translate into higher annual increments. This may compromise approaches modelling tree growth and forest productivity with canopy phenology and growth length.",2023,12,30

THE MOMENT ARMS AND LINES OF ACTION OF SUBSCAPULARIS AFTER THE LATARJET PROCEDURE.,"The Latarjet procedure is an established surgical treatment for recurrent glenohumeral joint instability with glenoid bone loss. Intraoperatively, the conjoint tendon is routed through a split in subscapularis to the coracoid bone graft, which is fixed to and augments the anteroinferior glenoid. The objective of this in vitro study was to quantify the influence of glenohumeral joint position and conjoint tendon force on the lines of action and moment arms of subscapularis muscle sub-regions after Latarjet surgery. Eight fresh-frozen, entire upper extremities were mounted onto a testing apparatus, and a cable system used to apply physiological muscle loading to the major shoulder muscles. The lines of action and moment arms of four sub-regions of subscapularis (superior, mid-superior, mid-inferior, and inferior) were quantified radiographically with the conjoint tendon unloaded and loaded while the shoulder was in (i) 0° abduction (ii) 90° abduction (iii) 90° abduction and full external rotation (ABER), and (iv) the apprehension position, defined as ABER with 30° horizontal extension. Conjoint tendon loading after Latarjet surgery significantly increased the inferior inclination of the lines of action of the mid-inferior and inferior sub-regions of subscapularis in the scapular plane in ABER and apprehension positions (p<0.001), as well as decreased the horizontal flexion moment arm of the inferior subscapularis (p=0.040). Increased subscapularis inferior inclination may ultimately increase inferior joint shear potential, while smaller horizontal flexion leverage may reduce joint flexion capacity. The findings have implications for Latarjet surgical planning and post-operative rehabilitation prescription. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",2023,12,30

Ectopic expression of C-type lectin Mincle renders mice susceptible to staphylococcal pneumonia.,"Staphylococcus aureus is a prevalent pathogen in pneumonia and harbors glycolipids which may serve as molecular patterns in Mincle (Macrophage inducible C-type lectin) dependent pathogen recognition. We examined the role of Mincle in lung defense against S. aureus in WT, Mincle KO and Mincle transgenic (tg) mice. Two glycolipids, glucosyl-diacylglycerol (Glc-DAG) and diglucosyl-diacylglycerol (Glc2-DAG) were purified, of which only Glc-DAG triggered Mincle reporter cell activation and professional phagocyte responses. Proteomic profiling revealed that Glc2-DAG blocked Glc-DAG-induced cytokine responses, thereby acting as inhibitor of Glc-DAG/Mincle-signaling. WT mice responded to S. aureus with a similar lung pathology as Mincle KO mice, most likely due to Glc2-DAG-dependent inhibition of Glc-DAG/Mincle-signaling. In contrast, ectopic Mincle expression caused severe lung pathology in S. aureus-infected mice characterized by bacterial outgrowth and fatal pneumonia. Collectively, Glc2-DAG inhibits Glc-DAG/Mincle-dependent responses in WT mice, whereas sustained Mincle expression overrides Glc2-DAG-mediated inhibitory effects, conferring increased host susceptibility to S. aureus.",2023,12,30

Low Parts Per Trillion Detection of Iodinated Disinfection Byproducts in Drinking Water and Urine using Vacuum-Assisted Sorbent Extraction and GC-MS/MS.,"Disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants, which are present in virtually all drinking water and linked to detrimental health effects. Iodinated-DBPs are more cytotoxic and genotoxic than chloro- and bromo-DBPs and are formed during disinfection of iodide-containing source water. Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) paired with gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS) has been the method of choice in the study of low molecular weight iodinated-DBPs; however, this method is laborious and time-consuming and struggles with complex matrices. We developed an environmentally friendly method utilizing headspace solid phase extraction with the application of vacuum to measure six iodinated-trihalomethanes (I-THMs) in drinking water and urine. Vacuum-assisted sorbent extraction (VASE) has the ability to exhaustively and rapidly extract volatile and semivolatile compounds from liquid matrices without the use of solvent. Using VASE with GC-MS/MS provides improved analyte recovery and reduced matrix interference compared to LLE. Additionally, VASE enables extraction of 30 samples simultaneously with minimal sample handling and improved method reproducibility. Using VASE with GC-MS/MS, we achieved quantification limits of 3-4 ng/L. This technique was demonstrated on drinking water from four cities, where five I-THMs were quantified at levels 10-33 times below comparable LLE methods with 10 times lower volumes of sample (10 mL vs 100 mL).",2023,12,30
Exploring the Impact of Nanoparticle Stealth Coatings in Cancer Models: From PEGylation to Cell Membrane-Coating Nanotechnology.,"Nanotechnological platforms offer advantages over conventional therapeutic and diagnostic modalities. However, the efficient biointerfacing of nanomaterials for biomedical applications remains challenging. In recent years, nanoparticles (NPs) with different coatings have been developed to reduce nonspecific interactions, prolong circulation time, and improve therapeutic outcomes. This study aims to compare various NP coatings to enhance surface engineering for more effective nanomedicines. We prepared and characterized polystyrene NPs with different coatings of poly(ethylene glycol), bovine serum albumin, chitosan, and cell membranes from a human breast cancer cell line. The coating was found to affect the colloidal stability, adhesion, and elastic modulus of NPs. Protein corona formation and cellular uptake of NPs were also investigated, and a 3D tumor model was employed to provide a more realistic representation of the tumor microenvironment. The prepared NPs were found to reduce protein adsorption, and cell-membrane-coated NPs showed significantly higher cellular uptake. The secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in human monocytes after incubation with the prepared NPs was evaluated. Overall, the study demonstrates the importance of coatings in affecting the behavior and interaction of nanosystems with biological entities. The findings provide insight into bionano interactions and are important for the effective implementation of stealth surface engineering designs.",2023,12,30
"NAC61 regulates late- and post-ripening osmotic, oxidative, and biotic stress responses in grapevine.","During late- and post-ripening stages, grape berry undergoes profound biochemical and physiological changes whose molecular control is poorly understood. Here, we report the role of NAC61, a grapevine NAC transcription factor, in regulating different processes featuring the berry ripening progression. NAC61 is highly expressed during post-harvest berry dehydration and its expression pattern is closely related to sugar concentration. The ectopic expression of NAC61 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves determines low stomatal conductance, high leaf temperature, tissue collapse and a higher relative water content. Transcriptome analysis of grapevine leaves transiently overexpressing NAC61, and DNA affinity purification and sequencing analyses allowed us to narrow down a list of NAC61-regulated genes. Direct regulation of the stilbene synthase regulator MYB14, the osmotic stress-related gene DHN1b, the Botrytis cinerea susceptibility gene WRKY52 and the NAC61 itself, is validated. We also demonstrate that NAC61 interacts with NAC60, a proposed master regulator of grapevine organ maturation, in the activation of MYB14 and NAC61 expression. Overall, our findings establish NAC61 as a key player in a regulative network that governs stilbenoid metabolism and osmotic, oxidative and biotic stress responses that hallmark late- and post-ripening grape stages.",2023,12,30

SARS-CoV-2 induced vascular endothelial dysfunction: direct or indirect effects?,"Clinical evidence reveals that manifestations of endothelial dysfunction are widely observed in COVID-19 and long-COVID patients. However, whether these detrimental effects are caused by direct infection of the endothelium or are indirectly mediated by systemic inflammation has been a matter of debate. It has been well acknowledged that endothelial cells (ECs) of the cardiovascular system ubiquitously express the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2, yet accumulating evidence suggests that it is more predominantly expressed by pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells of the mammalian blood vessel. Besides, replicative infection of ECs by SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we review latest research on endothelial ACE2 expression in different vascular beds, and the heterogeneity in various EC subsets with differential ACE2 expression in response to SARS-CoV-2. We also discuss ACE2-independent alternative mechanisms underlying endothelial activation in COVID-19, and the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2-induced endothelial dysfunction. Altogether, understanding ACE2-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving SARS-CoV-2-induced vascular dysfunction would shed light on strategies of more effective therapies targeting cardiovascular complications associated with COVID-19.",2023,12,30
Glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor family-related protein functions as a co-stimulatory molecule for murine eosinophils.,"Eosinophils are typical effector cells associated with type 2 immune responses and play key roles in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. These cells are activated by various stimuli, such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, but the regulatory mechanisms of eosinophil effector functions remain unclear. Glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor family-related protein (GITR), a transmembrane protein belonging to the TNF receptor superfamily, is a well-known regulatory molecule for T cell activation. Here, we show that GITR is also constitutively expressed on eosinophils and functions as a co-stimulatory molecule for these cells. Although degranulation was unaffected by GITR engagement of murine bone marrow-derived eosinophils (bmEos), secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, and IL-13 from IL-33-activated bmEos were augmented by anti-mouse GITR agonistic antibody (DTA-1). In conclusion, our results provide a new regulatory pathway of cytokine secretion from eosinophils where GITR functions as a co-stimulatory molecule.",2023,12,30
Further Evidence for a Dimensional Latent Structure of Health Anxiety: Taxometric Analyses of the Whiteley Index Based on Two German Representative Samples.,"Health anxiety is an intricate part of illness anxiety and somatic symptom disorder. Based on convenience samples, two out of three available studies indicate that it is a dimensional rather than a categorical construct. Using two representative datasets, this study investigates whether previous results can be clarified. Conventional taxometric analyses as well as comparison curve fit indices (CCFI) profile analyses (MAMBAC and MAXSLOPE procedures) were calculated with two datasets of the German adult population assessing the Whiteley Index (WI-14, <i>N</i> = 2,072; WI-7, <i>N</i> = 2,498). Mean CCFIs indicated a dimensional structure for both the WI-7 (mean CCFI = 0.42, mean CCFI profile = 0.40) and the WI-14 (mean CCFI = 0.44, mean CCFI profile = 0.32). The results support and extend previous findings by strongly suggesting a dimensional distribution of health anxiety in the general population. Implications for research and practice comprise the adoption of a dimensional description of psychopathology as well as transdiagnostic treatment approaches.",2023,12,30
"[Government, university medicine and epidemics in Siberia (late XIX - early XX century)].","The relationship between government and university medicine in the context of the development of the Asian ""colonial"" periphery of Russia in the late imperial period are studied. It is concluded that these relationship, the manifestations of which were most pronounced in the period of the fight against epidemics, are not quite standard from the point of view of model of the classical relationship between power and knowledge in the colonial context of European maritime empires. This is connected mainly with the social portrait of the university intelligentsia, with the peculiarities of their professional socialization, which led to the fact that in Siberia they broadcast the experience of the European metropolises, rather than the colonies.",2023,12,22
[Diagnosis and antibiotic therapy of nosocomial pneumonia in adults: from recommendations to real practice. A review].,"Nosocomial pneumonia is a healthcare-associated infection with significant consequences for the patient and the healthcare system. The efficacy of treatment significantly depends on the timeliness and adequacy of the antibiotic therapy regimen. The growth of resistance of gram-negative pathogens of nosocomial pneumonia to antimicrobial agents increases the risk of prescribing inadequate empirical therapy, which worsens the results of patient treatment. Identification of risk factors for infection with multidrug-resistant microorganisms, careful local microbiological monitoring with detection of resistance mechanisms, implementation of antimicrobial therapy control strategy and use of rational combinations of antibacterial drugs are of great importance. In addition, the importance of using new drugs with activity against carbapenem-resistant strains, including ceftazidime/aviabactam, must be understood. This review outlines the current data on the etiology, features of diagnosis and antibacterial therapy of nosocomial pneumonia.",2023,12,22
[A case of pleuropulmonary dirofilariasis caused by Dirofilaria repens. Case report].,"The differential diagnosis of neoplasms of various localizations is the primary task in clinical practice of all physicians. We present a description of the case of invasion with Dirofilaria repens in the lung of a 68-year-old patient. In 2016 the patient was diagnosed with cancer of the left kidney and underwent a left-sided nephrectomy. During the dynamic observation in 2019, a lump was found in the left lung, which was regarded as a metastasis. An atypical SIX resection of the left lung was performed. Microscopy of the removed lump revealed the presence of a nematode of the genus Dirofilaria, presumably D. repens. The species identity of D. repens was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using species-specific primers. It is known that the morphological identification of parasites up to the species in the surgical material presents certain difficulties and requires high professional training of the researcher. Therefore, the diagnosis of dirofilariasis in atypical localizations of nematodes in the human body is of great importance in the differentiation of malignant and benign formations, and the use of the polymerase chain reaction method can significantly increase the accuracy in establishing the final diagnosis.",2023,12,22

[Inflammatory bowel diseases: Transformation of representations. A review].,"The global burden of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is currently significant and continues to grow due to the increasing prevalence of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), the increasing costs of diagnosis and treatment, and the high level of disability in patients with this disease. Categories, which leads to the search for risk factors and predictors of aggressive course and extraintestinal manifestations. According to the latest data, the prevalence of UC in Russia is 16.6 per 100 000 population, the annual registered increase is 11.3%; the prevalence of CD is 5.6 per 100 000 population, and the increase is 13.7%. In the Russian population of patients with IBD, the average age of disease onset is 35.3 years for UC and 31.2 years for CD. Moreover, in 89.3% of patients with UC, it took at least 2 years to verify the diagnosis, and in CD, within 2 years from the onset of clinical symptoms, the diagnosis was established in only 72.6% of patients. One of the dominant characteristics of IBD is its multisystem nature, which leads to the development of extraintestinal manifestations (ECM), which can be observed in 50-60% of patients, while up to 25% of patients with IBD have several EMC and the most common variants are joint lesions. A higher frequency of extraintestinal manifestations is observed in CD (up to 45% of patients), in female patients, in smokers and with a longer duration of the disease. To predict clinical remission, the level of fecal calprotectin and CRP, the need for glucocorticosteroids are important, to predict endoscopic remission - the level of fecal calprotectin, and to predict histological remission, an endoscopic Schroeder index value of ≤1 is important. The absolute risk of developing colorectal cancer in IBD remains relatively low, ranging from 1.1 to 5.4% after 20 years of disease. The main risk factors for IBD are total intestinal damage, high inflammatory activity, the stricturing phenotype of CD and the presence of primary sclerosing cholangitis.",2023,12,28
[Current antiretroviral therapy: A review].,"The article presents an overview of clinical recommendations for currant antiretroviral therapy. Currently, the current preferred first-line antiretroviral therapy regimens are combinations of 2 or 3 antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) in one tablet with a frequency of administration 1 time per day and, as a rule, include drugs of the 2nd generation (integrase inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors). These schemes have high efficiency and a good genetic barrier in the development of HIV resistance mutations. HIV protease inhibitors are used as alternative regimens. Schemes with the least number and spectrum of side effects, no effect on metabolic processes and minimal drug interactions have advantages. Switching patients to injectable therapy regimens with a frequency of administration of drugs once every 2 months can significantly improve the quality of life of patients and, accordingly, adherence to their treatment. The development and introduction of new classes of ARVs into clinical practice ensures the suppression of HIV replication in most patients with HIV strains resistant to drugs of the main groups of ARVs (nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase.",2023,12,28

High efficacy of brigatinib for brain metastases in ALK fusion gene-positive non-small cell lung cancer: A case series.,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion gene-positive lung cancer often shows brain metastasis at initial diagnosis or during the course of treatment. However, molecular-targeted drugs are known to pass through the blood-brain barrier and present positive effects for central nervous system lesions. There are few reports suggesting how effective molecular-targeted drug therapy alone is for brain metastasis lesions of ALK fusion-positive lung cancer, especially after the first use of ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) or for bulky brain metastases. A patient in his mid-fifties with stage IV pleural dissemination developed brain metastases after 10 years of crizotinib use, but showed a complete response after switching to brigatinib. Moreover, a patient in her early sixties with stage III recurrent large brain metastases 5 years after chemoradiation therapy experienced dramatic tumor shrinkage with brigatinib. In each case of ALK fusion gene-positive lung cancer with brain metastases, brigatinib showed a high efficacy and was well-tolerated after previous ALK-TKI and for bulky lesions.",2023,12,30
"Toleration, discrimination, or acceptance? How majorities interpret and legitimize minority toleration depends on outgroup threat.","The notion of tolerance is widely embraced in plural contexts, but little is known about how majority members interpret the toleration of minorities. With four studies, we investigated majority group members' interpretations of a minority toleration situation (compared to full acceptance and discrimination situations) as a function of outgroup threat. Study 1 (N = 214) showed that higher perception of threat from Syrian refugees was associated with Turkish natives' stronger likelihood of interpreting a refugee toleration situation as 'acceptance'. Studies 2 (N = 161, threatening context: Syrian refugees-Turkish natives) and 3 (N = 206, non-threatening context: homosexuals-liberal heterosexual students) demonstrated that toleration was interpreted more as a form of acceptance in a high-threat context, whereas it was perceived more like discrimination in the non-threatening context. Experimental Study 4 (N = 150, pre-registered, Muslims-Christians in the UK) indicated that increasing outgroup threat led to higher legitimization of toleration, which, in turn, related to lower support of minority rights. It is concluded that outgroup threat affects how people interpret the way in which minorities are treated, which has implications for initiatives and policies that try to stimulate tolerance towards minority groups.",2023,12,30

Therefore, this study aimed to explore dyads' adjustment to type 1 diabetes, while examining the congruence/dissimilarity within these dyads. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 dyads (20 individuals) separately. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed with thematic analysis using a dyadic framework method. Findings suggested complex experiences of adjustment among parents and adolescents which reflect two main themes - Never-Ending Abyss of Management and Diabetes Integration, with three subthemes - A Life of Food Restrictions, Evolving Familial Bonds and Technology as easing the burden of Diabetes. Dyadic analyses revealed dyadic congruence across most themes.

"Lifetimes of Vulnerability: Childhood Adversity, Poor Adult Health, and the Criminal Legal System.","On average, incarcerated people have higher rates of poor health, mental illness, and histories of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) than the general population. This mixed-methods analysis examines the relationship between ACEs and poor adult health among a sample of formerly incarcerated people. The quantitative analysis (N = 122) shows childhood adversity is associated with various health conditions in adulthood, although the strength of this relationship varies by the kinds of ACEs respondents encountered. The qualitative analysis of life history timelines (N = 42) reveals two pathways relating ACEs to poor health and legal system involvement: (1) violence and victimization and (2) drug use as a coping mechanism. Unaddressed mental health challenges in the aftermath of adversity emerged as an important precursor to both pathways. Prisons lack a meaningful consideration of these early life events and the social structures that result in the high rates of vulnerable people in its care.",2023,12,30
Circadian rhythm regulation in the immune system.,"Circadian rhythms are a ubiquitous feature in nearly all living organisms, representing oscillatory patterns with a 24-h cycle that are widespread across various physiological processes. Circadian rhythms regulate a multitude of physiological systems, including the immune system. At the molecular level, most immune cells autonomously express clock-regulating genes, which play critical roles in regulating immune cell functions. These functions encompass migration, phagocytic activity, immune cell metabolism (such as mitochondrial structural function and metabolism), signalling pathway activation, inflammatory responses, innate immune recognition, and adaptive immune processes (including vaccine responses and pathogen clearance). The endogenous circadian clock orchestrates multifaceted rhythmicity within the immune system, optimizing immune surveillance and responsiveness; this bears significant implications for maintaining immune homeostasis and resilience against diseases. This work provides an overview of circadian rhythm regulation within the immune system.",2023,12,30
Degradation processes of brominated flame retardants dispersed in high impact polystyrene under UV-visible radiation.,"In order to protect human health and the environment, several regulations have been introduced in recent years to reduce or even eliminate the use of some brominated flame retardants (BFRs) due to their toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation. Dispersions of these BFRs in polymers are widely used for various applications. In this report, four different brominated molecules, decabromodiphenyl ether (DBDE), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) and tris(tribromophenoxy)triazine (TTBPT), were dispersed in the solid matrix of an industrial polymer, high impact polystyrene (HIPS). The possibility of degradation of these BFRs within HIPS under UV-visible irradiation in ambient air was investigated. The degradation kinetics of DBDE and HBCDD were followed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and high-resolution two-step laser mass spectrometry (L2MS). The thermal properties of the pristine and irradiated polymer matrix were monitored by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which showed that these properties were globally preserved. Volatile photoproducts from the degradation of DBDE, DBDPE and TTBPT were identified by headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Under the chosen experimental conditions, BFRs underwent rapid degradation after a few seconds of irradiation, with conversions exceeding 50% for HIPS/DBDE and HIPS/HBCDD systems.",2023,12,30
College Students' Adaptations of Activities and Experiences During the Pandemic Occupational Disruption.,"During life disruptions, people adapt their activities responding to environmental stressors, resulting in new routines that support well-being.

How and When Inclusive Human Resource Management Promotes Employee Well-Being: The Roles of Ambidextrous Fit and Affective Leadership.,"Researchers and practitioners have largely recognized the importance of human resource management in addressing the growing trend of workforce diversity to improve employee well-being. However, empirical research on inclusive human resource management (IHRM) remains scarce. Drawing on the conservation of resources theory and the person-environment fit framework, the current study constructs a moderated dual-mediation model to explore how IHRM influences employee well-being through ambidextrous fit (i.e., supplementary fit and complementary fit) and further examine the moderating role of affective leadership. Using three-wave data from 382 employees through the questionnaire survey, the empirical findings indicate that IHRM positively affects employee well-being and that this linkage is mediated by supplementary fit and complementary fit. In addition, we find that affective leadership strengthens the positive influences of IHRM on employee well-being, supplementary fit, and complementary fit as well as the indirect effect of IHRM on employee well-being through ambidextrous fit. We discuss some theoretical and practical implications of our findings and provide research directions.",2023,12,30
Therapy for the Dead: Working Clinically with Jung's Black Books and The Red Book.,"With the 2020 publication of the facsimile edition of The Black Books, we have an opportunity to study the layers of C.

In this paper, I explore Jung's practice of active imagination in relation to his fantasy dialogues with the dead during two specific episodes in 1914 and 1916. I discuss Jung's concept of the collective unconscious corresponding to the ""mythic land of the dead"" and I show how this idea develops in The Black Books and The Red Book, or Liber Novus, culminating in Septem Sermones ad Mortuos. I describe my work with a patient, who, in an early session, said she felt like the ""living dead"". I recount how the patient's experience of her own internal world began to change as we were able to wonder about the inner world of the patient's late mother and, together, to imagine her mother's lament.

Mesenchymal stem cells with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase interference ameliorate mouse ischemic stroke.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in the treatment of ischemic stroke. However, factors such as high glucose, oxidative stress, and aging can lead to the reduced function of donor MSCs. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is associated with various functions, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, senescence, differentiation, and paracrine secretion. This study examined the hypothesis that the downregulation of p38 MAPK expression in MSCs improves the prognosis of mice with ischemic stroke. Lentiviral vector-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was constructed to downregulate the expression level of p38 MAPK in mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs. The growth cycle, apoptosis, and senescence of MSCs after infection were examined. A mouse model of ischemic stroke was constructed. After MSC transplantation, the recovery of neurological function in the mice was evaluated. Lentivirus-mediated shRNA significantly downregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of p38 MAPK. The senescence of MSCs in the p38 MAPK downregulation group was significantly reduced, but the growth cycle and apoptosis did not significantly change. Compared with the control group, the infarct volume was reduced, and the neurological function and the axonal remodeling were improved in mice with ischemic stroke after transplantation of MSCs with downregulated p38 MAPK. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that in the p38 MAPK downregulation group, apoptotic cells were reduced, and the number of neuronal precursors and the formation of white matter myelin were increased. In conclusion, downregulation of p38 MAPK expression in MSCs improves the therapeutic effect in mice with ischemic stroke, an effect that may be related to a reduction in MSC senescence. This method is expected to improve the efficacy of MSCs in patients, especially in patients with underlying diseases such as diabetes, thus providing a basis for clinical individualized treatment for cerebral infarction.",2023,12,30
What Measures are Effective in Trauma Screening for Young Males in Custody? A COSMIN Systematic Review.,"Despite the available evidence identifying the high prevalence rates of potentially traumatic experiences in forensic populations, there is still a lack of evidence supporting the use of suitable assessment tools, especially for young males in custody. For services to identify, support, and offer trauma interventions to this cohort, practitioners require reliable and valid assessment tools. This systematic review (Open Science Framework registration: https://osf.io/r6hbk) identifies those tools able to provide valid, reliable, and comparable data for this cohort. Five electronic databases and gray literature were searched to identify relevant measures. Inclusion criteria: studies of tools to assess for trauma with males aged between 12 and 25 years-old in a custodial setting, any year of publication, and available in English. Exclusion criteria: studies that did not measure psychological trauma or include a standalone trauma scale, or report primary data. A three-step quality assessment method was used to evaluate the methodological quality and psychometric properties of the measures. Fourteen studies were selected for review (which included 12 measures). The studies sampled a total of approximately 1,768 male participants and an age range of 12 to 25 years. The studies reported on various types of psychometric evidence and due to the lack of homogeneity, a narrative synthesis was used to discuss, interpret, and evaluate each measure. The overall quality of the psychometric properties of the measures in this review showed that the currently available instruments for the assessment of trauma with young males in custody is limited but promising.",2023,12,30
32-year-old Traumatic Arteriovenous Fistula Presenting With Leg Ulcer and High-output Heart Failure.,"Traumatic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is not a common disorder, and dermatological signs and heart failure caused by AVF are rarely reported. We present the case of a 55-year-old woman who was referred for congestive heart failure symptoms. Echocardiography revealed preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Due to edema of the right leg with a long-standing leg ulcer and palpable femoral thrill, duplex ultrasonography was performed. It showed an AVF between the right superficial femoral artery (SFA) and the right femoral vein (FV). The patient recalled a 32-year-old gunshot injury that was not medically treated. After the diagnosis of AVF she was referred to a surgeon for an AVF ligation, with subsequent resolution of her symptoms. The differential diagnosis of leg ulcer with leg edema should include the possibility of AVF as a cause.",2023,12,30
Adenosine 2A receptor antagonists promote lymphocyte proliferation in sepsis by inhibiting Treg expression of PD-L1 in spleen.,"The spleen is essential for lymphocyte proliferation, which is associated to sepsis prognosis. Adenosine 2A receptor (A2AR) blocking promotes lymphocyte proliferation in sepsis, however the mechanism is uncertain. Our sepsis cecum ligation perforation model showed that blocking A2AR increased survival and CD4+ cell numbers in a spleen-dependent mechanism. The sequencing of the transcriptome of the spleen indicated alterations in the expression of genes involved in the control of lymphocyte proliferation by inhibiting A2AR, including a reduction in the expression of PD-L1. Flow cytometry analysis of PD-L1 expression intensity in splenic cell subpopulations revealed that the Treg cell subpopulation was the strongest PD-L1-expressing cell population, and Treg PD-L1 expression decreased after blocking A2AR. In vitro activation of A2AR was able to upregulate PD-L1 expression of Treg and boost Treg capacity to limit lymphocyte proliferation, while blockage of PD-L1 partly reduced A2AR-activated Treg's ability to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation. In addition, blocking CREB phosphorylation significantly inhibited A2AR-induced PD-L1 expression. According to the findings of our research, inhibiting A2AR improves the prognosis of sepsis by lowering the level of PD-L1 expression by Treg in the spleen and reducing the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation.",2023,12,30
Synergy of polymyxin B and minocycline against KPC-3- and OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in dynamic time-kill experiments: agreement with in silico predictions.,Combination therapy is often used for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. We previously demonstrated synergy of polymyxin B and minocycline against carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in static time-kill experiments and developed an in silico pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model. The present study assessed the synergistic potential of this antibiotic combination in dynamic experiments.,2023,12,30
An Online Program for Primary Care Practitioners to Enhance Confidence in Ability to Care for Patients With or at Risk of Painful Knee Osteoarthritis.,"Primary care practitioners (PCPs) care for the majority of patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Despite the existing evidence-based guidelines, PCPs often feel unequipped to evaluate and effectively treat patients with KOA. To address this need, we designed and implemented a free internet-based program focusing on the diagnosis and treatment of KOA. We assessed whether the program led to improvements in participants' confidence in their knowledge and skills related to effectively recognizing and caring for patients with or at risk of KOA.",2023,12,30
Carbon nanotube supported cobalt nickel sulphide nano-catalyst for degradation of chloroquine phosphate with peroxymonosulphate.,"Carbon nanotubes supported cobalt nickel sulphide nanoparticles (nano-NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>@CNTs) were successfully prepared by a hydrothermal method as heterogeneous catalyst which can be used as an activator of peroxymonosulphate (PMS) for the degradation of chloroquine phosphate (CQP). Based on characterisation techniques, the prepared catalyst has excellent surface properties and structural stability. When different concentrations of CQP were treated with 0.2 g/L nano-NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>@CNTs and 1.0 mM PMS, the highest degradation rate could reach 99.86% after 30 min. Under the interference of pH, common anions and humic acid in the water environment, the reaction system can still achieve high degradation efficiency, showing excellent anti-interference ability and practical applicability. Furthermore, in the nano-NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>@CNTs/PMS system, according to the identification results of reactive oxygen species, the free radical and non-free radical pathway are responsible for the degradation of CQP, and the PMS mechanism activation was comprehensively proposed. Twelve intermediate products were detected in the degradation process, and the possible degradation pathways of CQP were proposed. This toxicity analysis demonstrates that the intermediate products formed during CQP degradation pose lower environmental risks compared to the original pollutant. In addition, after using the catalyst four cycles, the removal efficiency of CQP remains above 80%, indicating the excellent reusability and low metal ion leaching characteristics. Therefore, the nano-NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>@CNTs synthesised in this research has broad application prospects in activating PMS for wastewater treatment.",2023,12,29
Could 70 be the New 60? Investigating the Association between Internet Use and Subjective Age among Chinese Older Adults.,"The widespread use of the Internet brings both opportunities and challenges for older adults.

The impact of FDI on industrial structure upgrading and carbon emission under the constraints of environmental regulation.,"Foreign direct investment (FDI) plays an important role in promoting industrial structure and curbing carbon emission. The study is based on panel data from 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2021 and verifies the impact of FDI under environmental regulation on industrial structure upgrading and carbon emission. The empirical results show that FDI under environmental regulation can inhibit carbon emission and promote industrial structure upgrading. The carbon emission reduction effect and industrial structure upgrading effect of FDI show regional heterogeneity, with the strongest effect in the eastern region, followed by the central region, and no significant effect in the western region. The moderating effect examination of environmental regulation illustrates that formal and informal environmental regulation can effectively regulate the relationship between FDI and carbon emission, but due to differences in various factors such as economic development level and population quality, the moderating effect also exhibits regional heterogeneity. In the mechanism test, industrial structure upgrading plays a perfect mediating role in the path of FDI inhibiting carbon emission, and environmental regulation can further enhance the mediating effect of industrial structure upgrading. There is a threshold of industrial structure upgrading between FDI and carbon emission, and FDI can only suppress carbon emission after crossing the threshold of industrial structure upgrading.",2023,12,29
Bronchoscopic Electrocautery Versus Adrenaline and Cold Saline Instillation for Prophylactic Haemostasis Prior to Biopsy of Endobronchial Lesions (BEVACS): A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Flexible bronchoscopy-guided endobronchial biopsy (EBB) is routinely performed as an outpatient daycare procedure. Bleeding after EBB is a common complication, that at times disrupts the procedure and can rarely lead to a catastrophe. We aimed to compare the efficacy of prebiopsy prophylactic bronchoscopic electrocautery with adrenaline and cold saline instillation in achieving hemostasis in patients with endobronchial lesions with a higher risk of bleeding during EBB.",2023,12,30
Effluent toxicity study using biomarkers for ciprofloxacin photoelectrocatalytic degradation by bismuth-doped titanium dioxide nanotubes.,"Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CIP) is a broad-spectrum synthetic antibiotic often found in domestic sewage and industrial waste due to the inefficiency of conventional treatments. Given the potential risk of drug accumulation, this study presents coatings of titanium dioxide nanotubes (TiO<sub>2</sub>) doped with different bismuth (Bi) concentrations to degrade CIP through photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical processes. Characterization studies revealed that bismuth (Bi) doping affected the morphology of the materials, with concentrations of 0.01 and 0.05 mol L<sup>-1</sup>, resulting in collapsed materials with a smaller active surface area. Photocatalysis tests for all the materials exhibited a similar degree of efficiency to photolysis, approximately 33%. Ecotoxicity tests using the biomarkers <i>Lactuca sativa L</i>., <i>Lemna minor</i>, and <i>Artemia salina</i> indicated that, although they were similar to photolysis in terms of efficiency, the effluents generated when employing the doped catalysts showed lower levels of toxicity, with the best results achieved for the material doped with 0.005 mol L<sup>-1</sup> of Bi, with a toxicity level approximately 40% lower. Photoelectrocatalysis proved to be the most efficient CIP degradation technique. The highest degradation rate was observed for materials doped with 0.005 mol L<sup>-1</sup> of Bi, with an efficiency of 46%, which is 1.4 times more efficient than photolysis. These results demonstrate that materials doped with low amounts of Bi can be effectively used as photoanodes for drug degradation, as their performance is superior, and the final product generated exhibits low toxicity to living organisms.",2023,12,29
Effect of two different crystal forms of alumina on hydration properties and mechanical properties of steel slag-cement composite cementitious materials.,"In the present work, two common nano-alumina (NA) with different crystal forms (α-NA and γ-NA) are used to research the effects of steel slag-cement composite cementitious materials, which include the hydration properties and mechanical properties. The results show that the NA can enhance the strength of steel slag-cement composite cementitious materials, especially the early strength. Meanwhile, when the addition amount of γ-NA was 1%, the maximum compressive strength and flexural strength at 28 d were 35.43 and 5.21 MPa, respectively; when the addition amount of α-NA was 3%, the maximum compressive strength and flexural strength at 28 d were 36.27 and 4.89 MPa, respectively. In addition, according to the analysis of X-ray diffractometer and differential thermal analysis, it was concluded that the effects of the two types of alumina on the strength were mainly pozzolanic effect and filling effect. The pozzolanic effect of γ-NA was significantly stronger than that of α-NA. However, the large surface area of γ-NA affected the dispersion of the particles and the filling effect. According to scanning electron microscope analysis, compared with α-NA, γ-NA had significantly more hydration products and tighter adhesion. In conclusion, the addition of NA not only improved the properties but further realized the value-added utilization of steel slag.",2023,12,29
Longitudinal Effects of Electronic Dating Violence on Depressive Symptoms and Delinquent Behaviors Across Adolescence.,"Depressive symptoms and delinquent behaviors that emerge during adolescence pose both short- and long-term negative outcomes. Though there is growing evidence that exposure to teen dating violence is also associated with a greater likelihood of depressive symptoms and delinquent behaviors such as engaging in peer violence and substance use, less is known about the effects of specific forms of electronic dating violence (i.e., electronic harassment, electronic coercion, and electronic monitoring) across adolescence on depressive symptoms and delinquent behaviors. Data were drawn from a 4-year prospective longitudinal study of two cohorts of youth followed from age 12 to 15 (<i>n</i> = 526, 52% female) and age 15 to 18 (<i>n</i> = 592, 53% female). Two mixed-effects models (stratified by cohort) were employed to evaluate depressive symptoms and delinquent behavior outcomes by exposure to electronic harassment, electronic coercion, and electronic monitoring, while accounting for verbal dating violence, physical dating violence, sexual dating violence, exposure to threat-based adverse childhood experiences, exposure to deprivation-based adverse childhood experiences, and gender across all four waves of data collection. Higher exposure to electronic sexual coercion was predictive of increased depression (β = .015, <i>p</i> = .018). Increased exposure to electronic sexual coercion (β = .007, <i>p</i> = .004) and electronic monitoring (β = .008, <i>p</i> = .045) were both predictive of more delinquency across adolescence. By delineating the effects of in-person verbal, physical, and sexual dating violence with unique electronic domains, we found unique additional risk from domains of electronic dating violence, which was particularly pronounced for youth who reported electronic sexual coercion. Electronic sexual coercion heightens the risk of depressive symptoms and delinquent behaviors in males and females beyond the risk presented by in-person forms of dating violence and should be accounted for in prevention and intervention programs. Future research should explore the effect of perceived normativity on the prevalence of electronic harassment and subsequent influence on outcomes.",2023,12,29
"Distribution of rapid HCV antibody self-test kits via needle/syringe dispensing machines: Implementation and evaluation of the Vend-C pilot study in Melbourne, Australia.","Recent guidance from the World Health Organization strongly recommended hepatitis C virus (HCV) self-testing. We implemented the Vend-C pilot study to explore the effectiveness and feasibility of distributing rapid HCV antibody self-test kits to people who inject drugs via needle/syringe dispensing machines (SDMs). Over a 51-day study period between August and September 2022, we distributed HCV antibody self-test kits via two SDMs. During the study period, 63 self-test kits were dispensed, averaging 1.2 self-test kits per day. Our access methods for evaluation questionnaires failed to attract participants (n = 4). We implemented the Vend-C pilot study in direct response to recent WHO recommendations. While self-test kits were effectively distributed from the two SDMs, our evaluation methodology failed. Consequently, we cannot determine the success of linkage to care. Even so, with HCV treatment numbers dropping in Australia, innovative engagement solutions are needed, and considering the number of self-test kits provided in our pilot, the model could have an important future place in HCV elimination efforts.",2023,12,29
Transmission bottleneck size estimation from de novo viral genetic variation.,"Sequencing of viral infections has become increasingly common over the last decade. Deep sequencing data in particular have proven useful in characterizing the roles that genetic drift and natural selection play in shaping within-host viral populations. They have also been used to estimate transmission bottleneck sizes from identified donor-recipient pairs. These bottleneck sizes quantify the number of viral particles that establish genetic lineages in the recipient host and are important to estimate due to their impact on viral evolution. Current approaches for estimating bottleneck sizes exclusively consider the subset of viral sites that are observed as polymorphic in the donor individual. However, these approaches have the potential to substantially underestimate true transmission bottleneck sizes. Here, we present a new statistical approach for instead estimating bottleneck sizes using patterns of viral genetic variation that arise de novo within a recipient individual. Specifically, our approach makes use of the number of clonal viral variants observed in a transmission pair, defined as the number of viral sites that are monomorphic in both the donor and the recipient but carry different alleles. We first test our approach on a simulated dataset and then apply it to both influenza A virus sequence data and SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from identified transmission pairs. Our results confirm the existence of extremely tight transmission bottlenecks for these two respiratory viruses.",2023,12,30
Green synthesis of magnetic silver nanocomposite: the photocatalytic performance of nanocomposite to decolorize organic dyes.,"The magnetite-silver nanocomposites (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-Ag NCs) were synthesized <i>via</i> a facile and green process by <i>Citrus sinensis</i> peel extract. The deposition of silver nanoparticles (NPs) was confirmed by observing an absorption peak at the maximum wavelength at 422 nm in the suspension solution of samples, which is related to silver surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The characteristic diffraction patterns of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and Ag phases were characterized utilizing the XRD patterns and the average size of the crystals was 21 nm. The photocatalytic behavior of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-Ag NCs was studied for the destruction of three organic dyes methyl green (MG), methyl orange (MO), and methylene blue (MB) below UV radiation. The effect of the amount of photocatalyst and volume of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant in the process of dye degradation was also investigated. The complete degradation time of dyes MB, MG, and MO under UV irradiation in the presence of 0.002 g Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-Ag NCs were 57, 33, and 49 min, respectively. The time of degradation reactions showed the high photocatalytic performance of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-Ag NCs. These results proved that the synergistic effect of magnetite in the role of supporting the silver NPs was a significant contribution to the excellent decolorization behavior of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-Ag NCs.",2023,12,29
The structural characteristics and physicochemical properties of mung bean protein hydrolysate of protamex induced by ultrasound.,"The limited physicochemical properties (such as low foaming and emulsifying capacity) of mung bean protein hydrolysate restricted its application in food industry. Ultrasound treatment could change the structures of protein hydrolysate to accordingly affect its physicochemical properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ultrasound treatment on the structural and physicochemical properties of mung bean protein hydrolysate of protamex (MBHP). Herein, the structural characteristics of MBHP were evaluated by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Tricine-SDS-PAGE), laser scattering, fluorescence spectrometer etc.. Solubility, fat absorption capacity, foaming, emulsifying and thermal properties were determined to characterize the physicochemical properties of MBHP.",2023,12,29
The Effect of Socioeconomic Deprivation on Radiographic Deformities in Children With Blount Disease.,"Blount disease can occur at any time during the growth process, primarily with a bimodal distribution in children younger than 4 years old and adolescents.

"Evaluation of gadolinium-based contrast agents in pregnant CD-1 mice and subsequent in utero exposure of the developing offspring, including behavioral evaluations.","The offspring of CD-1 mice exposed during pregnancy to one of seven gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) were evaluated for potential effects on postnatal development and behavior. The GBCAs, comprising four linear (gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadodiamide, gadobenate dimeglumine, and gadoxetate disodium) and three macrocyclic (gadoterate meglumine, gadoteridol, and gadobutrol), were administered via intravenous injection once daily from Gestation Day 6 through 17 following confirmed mating (Day 0) at doses of at least twice the human equivalent recommended clinical dose (i.e., 0.63 mmol Gd/kg for gadoxetate disodium and 2.5 mmol Gd/kg for the other GBCAs). All dams were allowed to deliver naturally. F0 generation females were monitored for maternal toxicity and gadolinium (Gd) levels in blood and brain. Offspring were evaluated for Gd levels in blood and brain at birth and on Day 70 postpartum. F1 generation mice were evaluated for survival and growth preweaning. Selected pups/litter were evaluated postweaning for sexual maturation, growth, and behavior. Gd was quantifiable in the brain of the F1 offspring on PND 1, with levels declining over time. There was no long-term effect of any GBCA on the growth and development of any offspring. There was no impact on neurodevelopment, as assessed by brain histology and validated neurobehavioral tests, including a battery of functional observational tests, motor activity, and learning and memory as evaluated in the Morris water maze.",2023,12,29
Hypoxia induced Galectin-8 maintains stemness in glioma stem cells via autophagy regulation.,"Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are the root cause of relapse and treatment resistance in glioblastoma (GBM).

Invasive haemodynamics at rest and exercise in cardiac amyloidosis.,Our aim was to investigate haemodynamics at rest and during exercise in patients with transthyretin cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) in light of the 2022 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines on pulmonary hypertension (PH).,2023,12,29
Education and learning: potential methodological and ethical issues in systematic reviews containing a meta-analysis: some critical reading suggestions for junior doctors.,"Junior doctors make clinical decisions regularly; therefore, they need to adequately interpret the evidence supporting these decisions. Patients can be harmed if clinical treatments are supported by biased or unreliable evidence. Systematic reviews that contain meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials are a relatively low-biased type of evidence to support clinical interventions. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that doctors will likely select this type of study to answer clinical questions. In this article, doctors are informed about potential methodological and ethical issues in systematic reviews that contain a meta-analysis that are sometimes not easily identified or even overlooked by the current tools developed to assess their methodological quality or risk of bias. The article presents a discussion of topics related to data extraction, accuracy in reporting, reproducibility, heterogeneity, quality assessment of primary studies included in the systematic review, sponsorship, and conflict of interest. It is expected that the information reported will be useful for junior doctors when they are reading and interpreting evidence from systematic reviews containing meta-analyses of therapeutic interventions, mainly those doctors unfamiliar with methodological principles.",2023,12,29
Exploring biomarkers in trigeminal neuralgia patients operated with microvascular decompression: A comparison with multiple sclerosis patients and non-neurological controls.,"Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a severe facial pain condition often associated with a neurovascular conflict.

Everolimus-induced hyperpermeability of endothelial cells causes lung injury.,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, everolimus (but not dactolisib), is frequently associated with lung injury in clinical therapies. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Endothelial cell barrier dysfunction plays a major role in the pathogenesis of the lung injury. This study hypothesizes that everolimus increases pulmonary endothelial permeability, which leads to lung injury. We tested the effects of everolimus on human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (HPMEC) permeability and a mouse model of intraperitoneal injection of everolimus was established to investigate the effect of everolimus on pulmonary vascular permeability. Our data showed that everolimus increased human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (HPMEC) permeability which was associated with MLC phosphorylation and F-actin stress fiber formation. Furthermore, everolimus induced an increasing concentration of intracellular calcium Ca<sup>2+</sup> leakage in HPMECs and this was normalized with ryanodine pretreatment. In addition, ryanodine decreased everolimus-induced phosphorylation of PKCα and MLC, and barrier disruption in HPMECs. Consistent with <i>in vitro</i> data, everolimus treatment caused a visible lung-vascular barrier dysfunction, including an increase in protein in BALF and lung capillary-endothelial permeability, which was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with an inhibitor of PKCα, MLCK, and ryanodine. This study shows that everolimus induced pulmonary endothelial hyper-permeability, at least partly, in an MLC phosphorylation-mediated EC contraction which is influenced in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner and can lead to lung injury through mTOR-independent mechanisms.",2023,12,29
Study Protocol for a Stepped-Wedge Cluster (Nested) Randomized Controlled Trial of Antenatal Colostrum Expression (ACE) Instruction in First-Time Mothers: The ACE Study.,"Although many mothers initiate breastfeeding, supplementation with human-milk substitutes (formula) during the birth hospitalization is common and has been associated with early breastfeeding cessation. Colostrum hand expressed in the last few weeks before birth, known as antenatal colostrum expression (ACE), can be used instead of human-milk substitutes.

Gallic acid alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced renal injury in rats by inhibiting cell pro-death and inflammatory response and its mechanism.,"The mechanism of gallic acid in improving lipopolysaccharide-induced renal injury in rats was investigated by studying the pro-death and inflammatory response of cells. SPF rats were randomly divided into 4 groups with n=10 in each group. Blank control group: normal saline injection; The model group was injected with LPS induced model (LPS group); Low dose gallic acid group (LPS+L-GA group); Middle dose gallic acid group (LPS+M-GA group). The expression of serum inflammatory factors IL-1, IL-1β, IL-18, and MCP-1 were detected by Elisa. Western blot assay was used to detect the expression of inflammation-related proteins. The contents of BUN, Scr, SUA, Serum cystatinALB, and ACR were determined by the biochemical analyzer. The pathological tissue sections were used to observe the kidney injury in each group. The renal expressions of NLRP3, Caspase-1, GSDMD, and IL-1β were detected by immunohistochemistry. The activation of the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway was detected by Western blot assay. The LPS-induced mouse kidney injury model was established successfully. Compared with the model group, different doses of gallic acid can improve the expression of renal biochemical indexes (P<0.05); At the same time, gallic acid can activate AMPK/SIRT1 and reduce kidney injury in mice (P<0.05); Compared with the model group, the expression of pyroptosis gene, the expression of genes related to inflammatory factors and the expression of inflammatory factors were decreased in the gallic acid injection group (P<0.05). By activating the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway, gallic acid can inhibit the scorch death and validation effect in mice, thereby protecting the kidneys of mice.",2023,12,10
"Seedless okra pod, chlorophyll, vitamin C and mineral content development using plant growth regulator in vitro and in vivo culture.","Vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber that keep a significant role in the functioning of the human body to refrain human health benefits. The experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of different concentrations of IAA on the seedless pod, chlorophyll, vitamin and mineral content of okra as human health benefits. The innovative seed soaking method of application using 0, 25, 50, 100 & 200 mg/l of IAA concentrations was used in okra before germination and cultured in vitro and in vivo. The lower concentrations (25 and 50 mg/l) of IAA significantly increased the pod setting compared to the higher concentration (100 and 200 mg/l). The higher concentration (100 and 200 mg/l) had lower fruit settings than the lower concentration (25 &50) had higher fruit settings. The higher pod size was obtained in the concentration of 100 & 200 mg/l of IAA (34.18 cm²) as compared to the control and other concentrations. In addition, the highest soluble solid content was obtained by 100 and 200 mg/l of IAA concentration as compared to the other concentrations. The maximum vitamin C was found in the concentration of 100 mg/l of IAA as compared to the control and other concentrations. Moreover, higher mineral contents like K, Ca, Mg, Na and Fe were found in 100 & 200 mg/l of IAA. The higher concentrations (100 and 200 mg/l) of IAA greatly increased the seedless okra percentage as compared to the lower concentration. It seemed that 100 and 200 mg/l concentration IAA was a better concentration for mineral content and seedless okra production as compared to the other concentrations.",2023,12,10
Evaluation value and mechanism of ADRB2 and FCER1B gene polymorphisms in preterm infants with congenital respiratory diseases.,"In this study, we observed the value of ADRB2 and FCER1B gene polymorphisms in evaluating congenital respiratory diseases in preterm infants (PTIs), analyzed their effects on airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), and preliminarily discussed the underlying mechanism. First, we placed 64 healthy PTIs (control group) and 45 PTIs with congenital respiratory diseases (research group) born at our hospital from April 2021 to June 2023 were selected as the research subjects. Through testing, we found that the carriers of AA genotype of the polymorphic marker rs1042713 of the ADRB2 gene and that of the rs569108 locus of the FCER1B gene were less in the research group compared with the control group (P<0.05). Preterm infants carrying the GG genotype had a 2.887-fold (P<0.05) increased risk of developing congenital respiratory disease under the recessive model at the rs1042713 locus of the ADRB2 gene. Under the dominant model, preterm infants who did not carry the AA genotype had a 3.070-fold (P<0.05) increased risk of developing congenital respiratory disease. Subsequently, the constructed abnormal expression vectors of ADRB2 and FCER1B were transfected into ASMCs to examine changes in cell activity and pyroptosis. We found that up-regulating ADRB2 and FCERIB expression promoted ASMC proliferation and inflammatory reactions, inhibited apoptosis, and accelerated pyroptosis (P<0.05); silencing their expression, however, led to the opposite effect. In conclusion, the ADRB2 and FCERIB gene polymorphisms are strongly correlated with congenital respiratory diseases, which can provide a reference for clinical evaluation of congenital respiratory diseases in PTIs.",2023,12,10
"A prospective study on disorders of sex development in Duhok city, Kurdistan region, Iraq: Genetic, etiology and clinical presentation.","Disorders of Sexual Development (DSD) encompass all types of intersex cases and have been reported globally. However, in Iraq, studies related to DSD are scanty.  The current single-center prospective study was carried out to find out the frequency, genetic and clinical presentation of different types of DSDs in the sample population of Duhok, Iraq. The sample comprises 40 DSD patients who have been referred to Hivi Pediatric Teaching Hospital in Duhok, Kurdistan region, Iraq, from June 2017 to June 2022. We conducted karyotype-based classification, laparoscopic-based internal organ diagnosis and abdominal ultrasound to diagnose DSDs in the target population. Of the total 40 cases, 19 (47.5%) were males, and 21 (52.5%) were females. Among them, 85 % were diagnosed as peno- scrotal hypospadias, 10% had clitoromegaly and the remaining were diagnosed as under-developed female-like genitalia. The majority of the patients were diagnosed with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) (55%), 37.5% were Testicular Feminization Syndrome (TFS) and the remaining were rare categories that we did not reach final diagnosis. Laparoscopy was done for 77.5 % of the participants of whom 30% had small uterus and ovaries, 25% had Intra-abdominal testes and the remaining had testes &ovaries, Mullerian Inhibitory Factor (MIF) deficiency and TFS. The study found different types of DSDs in the target population that requires both physical and psychological intervention. Future studies should focus on evaluating DSDs in larger populations and at multi-centers to understand the condition's trajectory in the Iraqi population.",2023,12,10
Investigation on the effect of ulinastatin on the apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells in rats with aortic dissection based on the Sirt1/FoxO3a pathway.,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of ulinastatin on the apoptosis and (Sirt1/FoxO3a) pathway of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in aortic dissection (AD) rats. For this purpose a rat model of aortic dissection (AD) was constructed by giving drinking water containing 0.08% β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) to rats, HE staining was used to observe the pathological changes of the aorta in AD rats; the diseased blood vessels of AD rats were taken for primary culture and passage of VSMCs, the morphology of VSMCs was observed, and VSMCs were identify with immunofluorescence staining; VSMCs were treated with culture media containing 0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000 U/mL ulinastatin, and MTT kit was used to determine the effect of ulinastatin on VSMC proliferation in AD rats; the VSMC of AD rats were divided into blank group (normal culture), ulinastatin group (medium containing 5000 U/mL ulinastatin), Sirt1 inhibitor group (medium containing 1 μmol/L EX527), ulinastatin + Sirt1 inhibitor group (medium containing 5000 U/mL ulinastatin, 1 μmol/L EX527), flow cytometry was used to detect the VSMC apoptosis in each group, WB was used to detect the expression of VSMC apoptosis-related proteins and Sirt1/FoxO3a pathway-related proteins in each group. Findings suggested that the aortic wall of AD rats was thickened, and the dissection false cavity appeared; VSMC mostly presented different shapes such as triangles and stars, the immunofluorescence staining results showed that α-SMA was arranged in the cytoplasm in the form of myofilaments, showing green fluorescence, and the nucleus showed blue fluorescence, and the rate of positive cells was more than 95%; various doses of ulinastatin had a certain inhibitory effect on the proliferation of VSMC, and 5000 U/mL ulinastatin had a higher proliferation inhibition rate; compared with the blank group, the VSMC apoptosis rate, Caspase-3, Bax protein, Sirt1/FoxO3a pathway related protein expression in the ulinastatin group were significantly increased, and the Bcl-2 protein expression was significantly decreased (P<0.05), the VSMC apoptosis rate, Caspase-3, Bax protein, Sirt1/FoxO3a pathway related protein expression in the Sirt1 inhibitor group were significantly decreased, and the Bcl-2 protein expression was significantly increased (P<0.05); compared with the ulinastatin group, the VSMC apoptosis rate, Caspase-3, Bax protein, Sirt1/FoxO3a pathway related protein expression in the ulinastatin + Sirt1 inhibitor group were significantly decreased, and the Bcl-2 protein expression was significantly increased (P<0.05). It was concluded that ulinastatin can inhibit the proliferation of VSMCs in AD rats and promote their apoptosis, which may be achieved by activating the Sirt1/FoxO3a pathway.",2023,12,10
"AZF microdeletion affects semen parameters, sex hormone levels, and chromosome karyotypes in infertile men in Xinjiang.","This study aimed to analyze the correlation between the microdeletion of different regions of the azoospermia factor (AZF) gene and semen parameters, sex hormone levels, and karyotypes in infertile males by retrospective study. This was performed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the clinical data of AZF microdeletion in infertile males, to guide clinical diagnoses and treatments, and to improve the efficacy and safety of assisted reproductive technology. For this purpose, Fifty-seven patients with AZF microdeletions and complete data were selected from 1916 patients with AZF microdeletions in our hospital from January 2020 to August 2022. The correlation between semen parameters, sex hormone levels, and chromosome karyotypes of these 57 patients was analyzed. Results showed that among the 57 patients with AZF microdeletions, the region with the highest microdeletion rate was AZFc with 57.89%; single or combined deletions in AZFa and AZFb regions resulted in azoospermia. The deletion frequency of AZFc in the oligospermia group was significantly higher than that in the azoospermia group, and the deletion frequencies of AZFb and AZFb + c in the azoospermia group were significantly higher than those in the oligospermia group (P<0.05). There were statistically significant differences in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, and chromosome karyotypes between patients with azoospermia and oligospermia (P<0.05). Statistically significant differences were observed in prolactin (PRL), FSH, testosterone (T), LH levels, and chromosome karyotypes of patients in different AZF microdeletion regions (P<0.05). In conclusion, AZF microdeletions can lead to a decline in semen quality in men, and different types of deletions have different effects on semen parameters, sex hormone levels, and karyotype analysis. Further treatments should be selected based on the AZF microdeletion area.",2023,12,10
Effects of microRNA-320 on learning and memory in mice with vascular cognitive impairment caused via cerebral ischemia.,"We aimed to explore microRNA (miR)-320's impacts on learning and memory in mice with vascular cognitive impairment induced via cerebral ischemia. After establishment of a cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) cognitive impairment model, application of corresponding treatment methods was in the model mice to inject miR-320 antagomir/agomir and their negative controls to the lateral ventricles: Test of the learning and memory abilities of mice was conducted; Detection of oxidative stress, inflammation, miR-320, Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endostatin (ES) was implemented; Taking mouse hippocampal neuron cells was to detect the cell advancement. MiR-320 was elevated in the CSVD model; MiR-320 was negatively linked with the learning and memory abilities of mice; Repressing miR-320 was available to memorably elevate the learning and memory abilities of CSVD mice; Depressing miR-320 clearly drove CSVD mouse neovascular protein VEGF, but reduced inflammation, oxidative stress response and ES; Restraining miR-320 was available to contribute to mouse neuronal cell advancement. MiR-320 mitigates the learning and memory abilities of cerebral ischemia-induced vascular cognitive dysfunction mice to a certain extent.",2023,12,10
MiR-20a-5p targets RBM24 and alleviates hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH) poses a significant challenge due to its high incidence, mortality, and diagnostic complexities. The underlying molecular mechanisms of HICH development remain enigmatic. In this study, we identified differentially expressed miRNAs in HICH patients by employing miRNA microarray analysis. We found that miR-20a-5p was one of the miRNAs significantly down-regulated in HICH patients and was significantly associated with clinicopathological features of the patients. Subsequently, Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were transfected with miR-20a-5p mimics or inhibitors to investigate the role of miR-20a-5p in proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and angiogenesis. Similarly, a mimic of miR-20a-5p or its inhibitor was injected into the HICH animal model and measured HICH markers in brain tissue. We next employed a bioinformatic approach to investigate the potential targets of miR-20a-5p which was further confirmed using gain and loss of function assays in HUVECs and animal models. The results show that overexpression of miR-20a-5p in HUVECs enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation while suppressing apoptosis, and attenuated HICH development in vivo. miR-20a-5p mediated its effects by directly targeting RBM24 and silencing RBM24 could partially recover the suppressive effects of miR-20a-5p on the development of HICH. Interestingly, miR-20a-5p hindered the development of HICH and its influence relied on the HIF1α/VEGFA pathway.",2023,12,10
Relationship between lipid profile and B‑type natriuretic peptide T‑381C (rs198389) gene polymorphism in patients with stable coronary artery disease.,"The research explored the link between Brain Natriuretic Peptides (BNP) gene promoter T-381C polymorphism, serum BNP, and lipid profiles in Kurdish people from Iraq with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). The study was conducted on 62 individuals with CAD and 31 without CAD (control group). DNA was extracted from each individual's sample using the Sanger sequencing method to study the BNP gene's polymorphism. The identified alleles were TT, TC, and CC. The frequency of the TT genotype decreased significantly among the patient group compared to the control group, while the CC genotype's frequency was higher (p<0.05). However, there was no significant increase in BNP levels in TC and CC genotypes compared to the TT genotype. Lipid profile values were not significantly different among the genotypes. The study utilized a cut-off value for BNP activity for predicting CAD and found that individuals with a BNP activity value less than the cut-off had significantly greater changes in lipid profile and renal function (p<0.05). Stepwise multivariate regression analysis showed that cholesterol was not the only primary determinant of BNP rate in subjects with stable CAD; oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL), a history of heart attacks, and oxidative stress malondialdehyde (MDA) had a significant effect. Homozygous C allele carriers at position 381 of the BNP precursors gene promoter were more likely to exhibit atherosclerosis lesions. We found that BNP rs198389 was not correlated with lipid profile and kidney disease.",2023,12,10
Therapeutic effects of Buyang Huanwu Tang combined with RT-PA intravenous thrombolysis on stroke of Qi deficiency and blood stasis type and its impact on Keap1-Nrf2/ARE pathway antioxidant stress.,"This study investigated the impact of combining traditional Chinese medicine, Buyang Huanwu Tang, with intravenous thrombolysis using alteplase (rt-PA) in treating ischemic stroke patients with qi deficiency and blood stasis. A single-center clinical randomized trial involved 117 ischemic stroke patients treated with rt-PA in the neurology department from January 2019 to December 2021. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (58 patients) received rt-PA alone, while the combined group (59 patients) received rt-PA along with Buyang Huanwu Tang. Neurological deficit scores (NIHSS) were assessed before and after treatment, along with hemorheological indicators, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and Keap1-Nrf2/ARE pathway oxidative stress indicators (Keap1, Nrf2, ARE, and NQO1 proteins). Before treatment, there were no significant differences between the groups. After treatment, the combination group exhibited lower NIHSS scores at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, indicating significant improvement compared to the control group. Additionally, the combination group demonstrated reduced plasma viscosity, low and high shear viscosity, and improved red blood cell aggregation compared to the control group after 8 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, the combination group showed elevated MMP-9 levels and reduced VEGF levels, suggesting favorable outcomes. Regarding the Keap1-Nrf2/ARE pathway, Nrf2 and NQO1 protein expression levels were higher in the combination group after 8 weeks of treatment. Clinical efficacy assessment revealed that the combined treatment group had a significantly better overall treatment response. In conclusion, combining Buyang Huanwu Tang with rt-PA intravenous thrombolysis effectively mitigated oxidative stress damage in the Keap1-Nrf2/ARE pathway among ischemic stroke patients with qi deficiency and blood stasis. This approach promoted neurological function recovery and improved overall treatment outcomes.",2023,12,10
The potential role of Epstein-Barr Virus in breast cancer development.,"We are looking into viral components that may contribute to breast cancer in order to find possible therapeutic targets. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which has been found to cause nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Burkitt lymphoma, is thought to play a role in breast cancer. Our series' patients had a median age of 49, with nearly half being under the age of 49. T2 tumors (two to five centimeters in size) make up the vast majority of our collection (60%). Six percent of our patients showed lymph node involvement, with roughly the same number in the N1 and N2 stages (41.17% each). Only 17.64% of people are at the N3 stage. SBR II tumors were the most common (90%). Only 20% of patients have HER2 overexpression, whereas 73.33% have ER expression. EBV was found in 23.33% of breast carcinomas (7 cases/30) after oncoprotein LMP1 expression, but normal surrounding tissues tested negative. We discovered that overexpression of the HER2 protein is inversely related to the two HRs' expression. They have no relationship with EBV infection and, consequently, LMP1 expression. LMP1 expression was not shown to be linked with patient age, tumor grade, tumor size, or lymph node invasion.",2023,12,10
Huatanmaitong tablet alleviate cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury with hyperlipidaemia in rats by regulating OATPs/VEGF axis.,"Stroke is the top priority pathogenesis of disability and death globally, affecting people worldwide. The presence of high levels of lipids in the blood has been confirmed as a vital factor of ischemic stroke. We aim to examine the effectiveness of Huatanmaitong tablet in hyperlipidemia rats that have experienced an ischemic stroke. We created a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with hyperlipidemia as a basis. Following 8 weeks of high-fat diet, the model rats underwent MCAO surgery. Subsequently, the rats were administered huatanmaitong tablets and lipitor tablets as treatments. Therefore there are five groups, CONTROL, MCAO, hyperlipidemia (HLP), Huatanmaitong tablet (HTMTT) and Lipitor (LIPITOR) groups respective ly. To assess the efficacy of the medication, the serum lipid levels of rats were measured both prior to and following administration. Hematoxylin eosin staining was used to observe the alterations in the brain and liver structures within each group. VEGF and OATPs related factors were detected in brain, liver by using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and Quantitative PCR. After the model was established successfully, the infarct volume and behavioral scores of the model group, hyperlipidemia group, Huatan Maitong tablet group and Lipitor group had statistical differences (P<0.05). Blood lipid levels of rats were measured before and after treatment, and it was found that Huatanmaitong tablets effectively reduced these levels. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the brain and liver showed that huatanmaitong tablets maintained the microstructure stability. Western blotting and real-time PCR revealed that Huatanmaitong tablets improved the expression level of organic anion transport (OATP1B1, OATP2B1) in rat tissues with ischemic stroke, enhancing the transmembrane transport of exogenous substances and maintaining homeostatic balance. Additionally, it down-regulated the expression of VEGF in various organs such as the brain, and liver, demonstrating the ability of Huatanmaitong tablets to remove phlegm, blood stasis, and promote circulation by regulating serum lipid levels, organic anion transport peptide, and VEGF in rats. The behavioral score of ischemic stroke rats can be improved and the neurological impairment symptoms of rats can be alleviated by Huatanmaitong tablet through the regulation of OATPS/VEGF axis.",2023,12,10
Expression and bioinformatics analysis of RPL38 protein and mRNA in gastric cancer.,"We aimed to clarify the expression of RPL38 in gastric cancer, explore the relationship between the expression level of RPL38 and the clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of gastric cancer patients, and explore whether RPL38 has the potential to be used as a therapeutic target for gastric cancer and a biomarker for assessing prognosis. The mRNA and protein expression of RPL38 in gastric cancer tissues and normal tissues were compared by TIMER, Kaplan-Meier plotter, CCLE and UALCAN databases, respectively. Next, the relationship between the expression level of RPL38 in gastric cancer tissues and clinicopathological features was analysed using the UALCAN database. The Kaplan-Meier plotter database was then used to predict the prognostic value of RPL38 in gastric cancer patients, and overall survival curves were plotted based on the follow-up information of clinical specimens. The relationship between RPL38 expression and the level of immune infiltration in gastric cancer was explored using the TIMER database. Finally, co-expression analysis as well as enrichment analysis of RPL38 was performed using LinkedOmics database and GSEA, respectively. Through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry experiments, we comprehensively concluded that RPL38 was highly expressed in gastric cancer. Univariate analysis showed that TNM stage (P=0.008), radiotherapy (P=0.02), and RPL38 expression level (P=0.0006) were associated with prognosis. Multifactorial analysis showed that RPL38 expression level (P=0.019), TNM stage (P=0.015) and radiotherapy (P=0.039) were independent risk factors affecting the prognosis of gastric cancer. Gastric cancer patients with high expression of RPL38 had poorer OS. In addition, RPL38 was associated with immune infiltration in gastric cancer. RPL38 is highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues, and RPL38 protein plays an important role in the development of gastric cancer, which is one of the important factors in assessing the prognosis of gastric cancer patients.",2023,12,10
Identification and investigation of protein-related molecules in patients with hyperlipidemia using label-free combined with bioinformatics analysis.,"This study aimed to identify proteins associated with high-fat diet patients and investigate their relationship with this dietary pattern. Five hyperlipidemia female patients and five normal individuals were included as the experiment and control groups, respectively. Blood samples were collected from both groups, and bioinformatics tools were employed for gene ontology annotation, KEGG pathway annotation, GO enrichment analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, and protein clustering to pinpoint genes, proteins, and pathways relevant to high-fat diet patients. Mass spectrometry analysis was subsequently used to confirm these proteins. The results indicated that bioinformatics analysis identified several proteins (P09871, P01019, P48740, P02654, P02649) potentially involved in the high-fat diet process by regulating downstream pathways. Label-free analysis revealed 3915 peptides in both groups, with 16 protein expression levels up-regulated in the experiment group, 13 of which showed significant differences. In contrast, 12 protein expression levels were down-regulated in the experiment group, with two showing significant differences. Notably, the proteins highlighted by bioinformatics analysis aligned with those identified through mass spectrometry. In conclusion, label-free analysis combined with bioinformatics can effectively identify proteins linked to high-fat diet patients. This research provides a fresh perspective on addressing high-fat diet-related issues using this approach.",2023,12,10
Structural and biochemical basis of FLS2-mediated signal activation and transduction in rice.,"The receptor-like kinase FLAGELLIN-SENSITIVE 2 (FLS2) functions as a bacterial flagellin receptor localized on the cell membrane of plants. In Arabidopsis, the co-receptor BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (BAK1) cooperates with FLS2 to detect the flagellin epitope flg22, resulting in the formation of a signaling complex that triggers plant defense responses. However, the co-receptor responsible for recognizing and signaling the flg22 epitope in rice remains undetermined, and the precise structural mechanism underlying FLS2-mediated signal activation and transduction has not been elucidated. This study presents the structural characterization of a kinase-dead mutant of the intracellular kinase domain of OsFLS2 (OsFLS2-KD<sup>D1013A</sup>) in complex with ATP or ADP, resolved at resolutions of 1.98 Å and 2.09 Å, respectively. Structural analysis reveals that OsFLS2 can adopt an active conformation in the absence of phosphorylation, albeit exhibiting significantly weak basal catalytic activity for autophosphorylation. Subsequent investigations demonstrate that OsSERK2 effectively phosphorylates OsFLS2, which reciprocally phosphorylates OsSERK2, leading to the complete activation of OsSERK2 and the rapid phosphorylation of the downstream substrate receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases OsRLCK176 and OsRLCK185. Through mass spectrometry experiments, we successfully identified critical autophosphorylation sites on OsSERK2, as well as sites transphosphorylated by OsFLS2. Furthermore, we demonstrated the interaction between OsSERK2 and OsFLS2, which is enhanced in the presence of flg22. Additionally, our genetic evidence suggests that OsRLCK176 and OsRLCK185 may function downstream of the OsFLS2-mediated signaling pathway. Our study elucidates the molecular mechanism of OsFLS2-mediated signal transduction pathways in rice and provides a valuable example for comprehending RLK-mediated signal pathways in plants.",2023,12,28
Actin-depolymerizing factors 8 and 11 promote root hair elongation at high pH.,"Root hair is a polarly elongated single-celled tissue that derives from root epidermal cell for uptake of water and nutrient from the surrounding environment. Previous reports have demonstrated that short periods of high pH inhibited root hair extension, however, the effects of long-term high-pH treatment on the growth of root hairs is still unclear. Here, we reported that duration of root hair elongation is significantly prolonged with increasing external pH, which counteracts the effect of decreasing root hair elongation rate and ultimately produces longer root hairs, whereas loss of actin-depolymerizing factors 8 and 11 (ADF8/11) function causes shortening of root hair length at high pH (7.4). The accumulation of ADF8/11 at the tips of root hairs is inhibited by high pH and the increasing of environment pH impacts the actin filament (F-actin) meshwork at the root hair tip. At high pH, the tip-focused F-actin meshwork of adf8/11 mutant root hairs are absent, and actin filaments at the adf8/11 root hair tips are disordered accompanied with attenuated actin turnover. Furthermore, secretory and recycling vesicles in adf8/11 root hairs could not be aggregated in the apical region of root hairs at high pH. Together, our results suggest that under long-term exposure to high extracellular pH, ADF8/11 may establish and maintain the tip-focused F-actin meshwork to regulate the polar trafficking of secretory/recycling vesicles at the root hair tips, thereby promoting the elongation of root hairs.",2023,12,29
The stingless bee Trigona spinipes (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is at risk from a range of insecticides via direct ingestion and trophallactic exchanges.,"The stingless bee, Trigona spinipes, is an important pollinator of numerous native and cultivated plants. Trigona spinipes population can be negatively impacted by insecticides commonly used for pest control in crops. However, this species has been neglected in toxicological studies. Here we observed the effects of seven insecticides on the survival of bees that had fed directly on insecticide-contaminated food sources or received insecticides via trophallactic exchanges between nestmates. The effects of insecticides on flight behavior were also determined for the compounds considered to be of low toxicity.",2023,12,29

The microRNA-193a-5p induced ROS production and disturbed colocalization between STAT3 and androgen receptor play critical roles in cornin induced apoptosis.,"Though cornin is known to induce angiogenic, cardioprotective, and apoptotic effects, the apoptotic mechanism of this iridoid monoglucoside is not fully understood in prostate cancer cells to date. To elucidate the antitumor mechanism of cornin, cytotoxicity assay, cell cycle analysis, Western blotting, RT-qPCR, RNA interference, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement, and inhibitor assay were applied in this work. Cornin exerted cytotoxicity, increased sub-G1 population, and cleaved PARP and caspase3 in LNCaP cells more than in DU145 cells. Consistently, cornin suppressed phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and disrupted the colocalization of STAT3 and androgen receptor (AR) in LNCaP and DU145 cells, along with suppression of AR, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and 5α-reductase in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, cornin increased ROS production and the level of miR-193a-5p, while ROS inhibitor N-acetylcysteine disturbed the ability of cornin to attenuate the expression of AR, p-STAT3, PSA, pro-PARP, and pro-caspase3 in LNCaP cells. Notably, miR-193a-5p mimics the enhanced apoptotic effect of cornin, while miR-193a-5p inhibitor reverses the ability of cornin to abrogate AR, PSA, and STAT3 in LNCaP cells. Our findings suggest that ROS production and the disturbed crosstalk between STAT3 and AR by microRNA-193a-5p are critically involved in the apoptotic effect of cornin in prostate cancer cells.",2023,12,29
Microfluidic Giant Polymer Vesicles Equipped with Biopores for High-Throughput Screening of Bacteria.,"Understanding the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance is critical for the development of new therapeutics. Traditional methods for testing bacteria are often limited in their efficiency and reusability. Single bacterial cells can be studied at high throughput using double emulsions, although the lack of control over the oil shell permeability and limited access to the droplet interior present serious drawbacks. Here, a straightforward strategy for studying bacteria-encapsulating double emulsion-templated giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) is introduced. This microfluidic approach serves to simultaneously load bacteria inside synthetic GUVs and to permeabilize their membrane with the pore-forming peptide melittin. This enables antibiotic delivery or the influx of fresh medium into the GUV lumen for highly parallel cultivation and antimicrobial efficacy testing. Polymer-based GUVs proved to be efficient culture and analysis microvessels, as microfluidics allow easy selection and encapsulation of bacteria and rapid modification of culture conditions for antibiotic development. Further, a method for in situ profiling of biofilms within GUVs for high-throughput screening is demonstrated. Conceivably, synthetic GUVs equipped with biopores can serve as a foundation for the high-throughput screening of bacterial colony interactions during biofilm formation and for investigating the effect of antibiotics on biofilms.",2023,12,29

Protein kinase CK2: An emerging regulator of cellular metabolism.,"The protein kinase casein kinase 2 (CK2) exerts its influence on the metabolism of three major cellular substances by phosphorylating essential protein molecules involved in various cellular metabolic pathways. These substances include hormones, especially insulin, rate-limiting enzymes, transcription factors of key genes, and cytokines. This regulatory role of CK2 is closely tied to important cellular processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. Additionally, tumor cells undergo metabolic reprogramming characterized by aerobic glycolysis, accelerated lipid β-oxidation, and abnormally active glutamine metabolism. In this context, CK2, which is overexpressed in various tumors, also plays a pivotal role. Hence, this review aims to summarize the regulatory mechanisms of CK2 in diverse metabolic pathways and tumor development, providing novel insights for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of metabolism-related diseases and cancers.",2023,12,29

Titin takes centerstage among cytoskeletal contributions to myocardial passive stiffness.,"Both diastolic filling and systolic pumping of the heart are dependent on the passive stiffness characteristics of various mechanical elements of myocardium. However, the specific contribution from each element, including the extracellular matrix, actin filaments, microtubules, desmin intermediate filaments, and sarcomeric titin springs, remains challenging to assess. Recently, a mouse model allowing for precise and acute cleavage of the titin springs was used to remove one mechanical element after the other from cardiac fibers and record the effect on passive stiffness. It became clear that the stiffness contribution from each element is context-dependent and varies depending on strain level and the force component considered (elastic or viscous); elements do not act in isolation but in a tensegral relationship. Titin is a substantial contributor under all conditions and dominates the elastic forces at both low and high strains. The contribution to viscous forces is more equally shared between microtubules, titin, and actin. However, the extracellular matrix substantially contributes to both force components at higher strain levels. Desmin filaments may bear low stiffness. These insights enhance our understanding of how different filament networks contribute to passive stiffness in the heart and offer new perspectives for targeting this stiffness in heart failure treatment.",2023,12,29
Rapid Analysis of Fentanyl and Fentanyl Analogues from Whole Blood Using SPME Coupled to the Microfluidic Open Interface.,"Fentanyl and its analogues are potent opioids that pose a significant threat to society. Over the last several years, considerable focus has been on the concerning trend of increasing fentanyl usage among drug users. Fentanyl analogues are mainly synthesized to evade analytical detection or increase their potency; thus, very low concentrations are sufficient to achieve a therapeutic effect. In an effort to help combat the synthetic opioid epidemic, developing targeted mass spectrometric methods for quantifying fentanyl and its analogues at ultralow concentrations is incredibly important. Most methods used to analyze fentanyl and its analogues from whole blood require manual sample preparation protocols (solid-phase extraction or liquid-liquid extraction), followed by chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric detection. The main disadvantages of these methods are the tedious sample preparation workflows, resulting in lengthy analysis times. To mitigate these issues, we present a targeted method capable of analyzing 96 samples containing fentanyl, several fentanyl analogues, and a common fentanyl (analogue) precursor simultaneously in 2.4 min per sample. This is possible by using a high-throughput solid phase microextraction workflow on the Concept96 autosampler followed by manual coupling of solid-phase microextraction fibers to the microfluidic open interface for tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Our quantitative method is capable of extremely sensitive analysis, with limits of quantification ranging from 0.002 to 0.031 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and linearity ranging from 0.010 to 25.0 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>. The method shows very good reproducibility (1-18%), accuracy (81-100%) of calibration and validation points, and good interday reproducibility (6-15%).",2023,12,29
N6-methyladenosine in myeloid cells: a novel regulatory factor for inflammation-related diseases.,"N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is one of the most abundant epitranscriptomic modifications on eukaryotic mRNA. Evidence has highlighted that m<sup>6</sup>A is altered in response to inflammation-related factors and it is closely associated with various inflammation-related diseases. Multiple subpopulations of myeloid cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes, are crucial for the regulating of immune process in inflammation-related diseases. Recent studies have revealed that m<sup>6</sup>A plays an important regulatory role in the functional of multiple myeloid cells. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the function of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in myeloid cells from the perspective of myeloid cell production, activation, polarization, and migration. Furthermore, we discuss how m<sup>6</sup>A-mediated myeloid cell function affects the progression of inflammation-related diseases, including autoimmune diseases, chronic metabolic diseases, and malignant tumors. Finally, we discuss the challenges encountered in the study of m<sup>6</sup>A in myeloid cells, intended to provide a new direction for the study of the pathogenesis of inflammation-related diseases.",2023,12,30
Impact of Receiving Genetic Diagnoses on Parents' Perceptions of Their Children with Autism and Intellectual Disability.,"To assess whether genetic test results identifying the cause of a child's autism, when accompanied by other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), including intellectual disability, alter how parents perceive and treat their child. 28 parents of 22 individuals with autism (mean age: 15 years), usually with other NDDs, were interviewed after receiving genetic diagnoses indicating a de novo mutation through the Simons Foundation Powering Autism Research for Knowledge study. Diagnosis of a de novo genetic variant can alter parental perceptions of offspring with autism and other NDDs. Parents often blamed their child less, saw their child as less in control of symptoms, and developed more patience, framing expectations accordingly. Parents had mixed feelings about receiving genetic diagnoses, with sadness sometimes accompanying reframed expectations. Genetic diagnoses could change views of the child among extended family members, teachers, social service agencies, insurers, and broader communities and society. Genetic testing might also reduce delays in diagnoses of autism among African American, Latino and other children. These data, the first to examine several critical aspects of how parents and others view children with autism and other NDDs after receiving genetic diagnoses, highlight vital needs for education of multiple stakeholders (including geneticists, other physicians, genetic counselors, parents, individuals with autism, social service agencies, insurers, policymakers, and the broader public), research (to include perspectives of extended family members, insurers, social service agencies and teachers) and practice (to increase recognition and awareness of the potential benefits and effects of genetic testing for such children).",2023,12,29
How ESG reporting is effected by sustainable finance and green innovation: moderating role of sales growth.,"In light of the conflicting findings within the existing empirical literature regarding the factors influencing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures in the context of sustainable investment and firms' green innovation performance (GIP), our current study stands out as a distinctive research endeavor that examines how the relationship is influenced by the moderating effects of sales growth. Non-financial trade manufacturing companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges between 2015 and 2020 were selected for this study. For data estimation, panel regression estimations using OLS and fixed effects models have been used. The results demonstrate a significant moderation of manufacturing industry's sales growth in China on the relationship between ESG disclosures and sustainable finance (operationalized by green credit, and green investment), and green innovation (operationalized by R&D intensity and green patents). Several practical takeaways are offered to boost green innovation performance among ESG reporting enterprises and increase the effectiveness of R&D intensity. These findings, including policy recommendations, will benefit all stakeholders.",2023,12,29
Can factor substitution reduce the shadow price of air pollution embodied in international trade? A worldwide perspective.,"The calculation of trade-embodied air pollution (TEAP) and its economic losses can be reasonably used to assess the impact of transboundary air pollution. However, these air pollutants, which are associated with international trade, can be easily ignored due to their concealment. Based on this, the global multiregional input‒output model (MRIO) is used to quantify the volume of five air pollutants that are embodied in the trade of 20 countries from 2000 to 2016. Then, the shadow price of trade-embodied air pollution (SPTEAP) and the elasticity of factor substitution (EFS) are both calculated by applying the translog production function. Finally, impulse response analysis is used to study the dynamic impact of EFS on the SPTEAP. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) All countries experienced a mass transfer of TEAP, among which China and the USA are the developing and developed countries with the largest amount of TEAP transfers, respectively. (2) The SPTEAP and EFS vary greatly among countries, and these values are generally higher in developed countries than in developing countries. The relationship between the three EFSs can be expressed as [Formula: see text] in all countries, thus indicating that improving the technological level of a country is the best solution for reducing the TEAP in that country while incurring the lowest cost and the least difficulty.

Small extracellular vesicle-based human melanocyte and melanoma signature.,"Intercellular communication is a cell-type and stimulus-dependent event driven not only by soluble factors but also by extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs include vesicles of different size and origin that contain a myriad of molecules. Among them, small EVs (sEV; <200 nm) have been shown to modulate not just regional cell responses but also distant organ behavior. In cancer, distant organ modulation by sEVs has been associated to disease dissemination, which is one of the main concerns in melanoma. Description of broadly conserved alterations in sEV-contained molecules represents a strategy to identify key modifications in cellular communication as well as new disease biomarkers. Here, we characterize proteomes of cutaneous melanocyte and melanoma-derived sEVs to deepen on the landscape of normal and disease-related cell communication. Results reveal the presence of unique protein signatures for melanocytes and melanoma cells that reflect cellular transformation-related profound modifications. Melanocyte-derived sEVs are enriched in oxidative metabolism (e.g., aconitase 2, ACO2) or pigmentation (e.g., tyrosinase, TYR) related proteins while melanoma-derived sEVs reflect a generalized decrease in mature melanocytic markers (e.g., melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells 1, MART-1, also known as MLANA) and an increase in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related adhesion molecules such as tenascin C (TNC).",2023,12,29
Effects of Apex Size on Dissolution Profiles in the USP II Paddle Apparatus.,"The use of apex vessels may solve coning problems associated with dissolution testing. However, excessive dissolution acceleration can reduce the discriminatory power. This study aimed to clarify how different apex vessel sizes affect the dissolution behavior of cone-forming formulations. Five apex vessels with different heights, centralities, and compendial vessels were used. The paddle rotation speed at which the coning phenomenon resolved was measured using standard particles of different densities. Three model formulations-USP prednisone tablets, atorvastatin calcium hydrate tablets, and levofloxacin fine granules-were selected, and dissolution tests were conducted at 30-100 revolutions per minute (rpm). Compared to the compendial vessels, the disappearance of standard particles at the apex base at lower paddle speeds in apex vessels was observed. Standard particles tended to remain in the center of the apex vessels and disappear at rotational speeds comparable to those of the compendial vessels. Dissolution increased in an apex height-dependent manner in the model formulations, except for the atorvastatin calcium hydrate tablets at 50 rpm. For levofloxacin fine granules, dissolution was also improved by reducing the paddle agitation speed to 30 rpm in the compendial vessels. Differences in apex centrality by 3 mm did not affect the dissolution rate. Our results indicate that apex vessels with low apex heights have a mount-resolving effect, but the degree of dissolution improvement by avoiding the coning phenomenon depends on the formulation characteristics used in the dissolution tests.",2023,12,29

Ameliorating the effects of multiple stresses on agronomic traits in crops: modern biotechnological and omics approaches.,"While global climate change poses a significant environmental threat to agriculture, the increasing population is another big challenge to food security. To address this, developing crop varieties with increased productivity and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses is crucial. Breeders must identify traits to ensure higher and consistent yields under inconsistent environmental challenges, possess resilience against emerging biotic and abiotic stresses and satisfy customer demands for safer and more nutritious meals. With the advent of omics-based technologies, molecular tools are now integrated with breeding to understand the molecular genetics of genotype-based traits and develop better climate-smart crops. The rapid development of omics technologies offers an opportunity to generate novel datasets for crop species. Identifying genes and pathways responsible for significant agronomic traits has been made possible by integrating omics data with genetic and phenotypic information. This paper discusses the importance and use of omics-based strategies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and phenomics, for agricultural and horticultural crop improvement, which aligns with developing better adaptability in these crop species to the changing climate conditions.",2023,12,29

Valorization of Cheese Whey Powder by Two-Step Fermentation for Gluconic Acid and Ethanol Preparation.,"Whey from cheesemaking is an environmental contaminant with a high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), containing an abundance of lactose. Hence, it has the potential to be utilized in the manufacturing of bio-based chemicals that have increased value. A designed sequential fermentation approach was employed in this research to convert enzymatic hydrolysate of cheese whey (primarily consists of glucose and galactose) into gluconic acid and bio-ethanol. This conversion was achieved by utilizing Gluconobacter oxydans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Glucose in the enzyme hydrolysate will undergo preferential oxidation to gluconic acid as a result of the glucose effect from Gluconobacter oxydans. Subsequently, Saccharomyces cerevisiae will utilize the remaining galactose exclusively for ethanol fermentation, while the gluconic acid in the fermentation broth will be retained. As a result, approximately 290 g gluconic acid and 100 g ethanol could be produced from 1 kg of cheese whey powder. Simultaneously, it was feasible to collect a total of 140 g of blended protein, encompassing cheese whey protein and bacterial protein. Two-step fermentation has proven to be an effective method for utilizing cheese whey in a sustainable manner.",2023,12,30
Development of brimonidine niosomes laden contact lenses for extended release and promising delivery system in glaucoma treatment.,"Increased intraocular pressure is a common symptom of glaucoma. In severe circumstances, it may result in loss of eyesight. Glaucoma treatment is difficult due to ocular physiological barriers that prevent medications from reaching the afflicted area. Traditional formulations (eye drops) have a short residence period and are rapidly drained away via the nasolacrimal duct, resulting in increased adverse drug responses and lower efficacy. The usage of nanoparticles such as niosomes could be one potential answer to these problems. While niosomes improve drug penetration, they have little effect on ocular retention of the medication. Contact lenses containing niosomes can assist to overcome this disadvantage.",2023,12,29

"Isolation, characterization of Weissella confusa and Lactococcus lactis from different milk sources and determination of probiotic features.","This study aimed to investigate the probiotic properties of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) isolates derived from various milk sources. These isolates identified based on their morphological characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Four strains of Lactococcus lactis and two strains of Weissella confusa were identified with over 96% 16S rRNA gene similarity according to the NCBI-BLAST results. The survival of the isolates was determined in low pH, pepsin, bile salts, and pancreatin, and their adhesion ability was assessed by in vitro cell adhesion assay, hydrophobicity, auto- and co-aggregation, and safety criteria were determined by hemolytic, gelatinase activities, and DNAse production ability tests. The results showed that the LAB isolates had different levels of resistance to various stress factors. L. lactis subsp. cremoris MH31 showed the highest resistance to bile salt, while the highest pH resistance was observed in L. lactis MH31 at pH 3.0. All the isolates survived in pepsin exposure at pH 3.0 for 3 h. The auto-aggregation test results showed that all strains exhibited auto-aggregation ranging from 84.9 to 91.4%. Co-aggregation percentage ranged from 19 - 54% and 17 - 57% against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, respectively. The hydrophobicity capacity of the LAB isolated ranged from 35-61%. These isolates showed different adhesion abilities to Caco-2 cells (81.5% to 92.6%). None of the isolates exhibited DNase, gelatinase and hemolytic activity (γ-hemolysis). All results indicate that these LAB strains have the potential to be used as probiotics.",2023,12,30
Bacterial microbiome changes after fecal transplantation for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in the Brazilian center.,"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) poses a significant global health threat owing to its substantial morbidity and associated healthcare costs. A key challenge in controlling CDI is the risk of multiple recurrences, which can affect up to 30% of patients. In such instances, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is increasingly recognized as the optimal treatment. However, few related studies have been conducted in developing countries, and the microbiota composition of Brazilian patients and its dynamic modification post-FMT remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in the bacterial gut microbiome in Brazilian patients with recurrent CDI post-FMT. Ten patients underwent FMT, and the primary and overall CDI resolution rates were 80% and 90% after the first and second FMT, respectively. FMT was associated with an early increase in Shannon's diversity, evident as soon as 1 week post-FMT and persisting for at least 25 days post-treatment. Post-treatment, the abundance of Firmicutes increased and that of Proteobacteria decreased. Specifically, the abundance of the genera Ruminococcus, Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, and Roseburia of the Firmicutes phylum was significantly higher 1 week post-transplantation, with Ruminococcus and Faecalibacterium remaining enriched 25 days post-transplantation. This study is the first of its kind in Brazil to evaluate the microbiota of a donor and patients undergoing FMT. Our findings suggest that FMT can induce remarkable changes in the gut microbiota, characterized by an early and sustained increase in diversity lasting at least 25 days. FMT also promotes enrichment of genera such as Ruminococcus spp., Faecalibacterium spp., and Roseburia spp., essential for therapeutic success.",2023,12,29

Quercetin Supplementation Alleviates Cadmium Induced Genotoxicity-Mediated Apoptosis in Caprine Testicular Cells.,"Being a common environmental pollutant, cadmium causes detrimental health effects, including testicular injury. Herein, we document the ameliorative potential of quercetin, a potent antioxidant, against cadmium-induced geno-cytotoxicity and steroidogenic toxicity in goat testicular tissue. Cadmium induced different comet types (Type 0 - Type 4), indicating the varying degree of DNA-damage in testicular cells. The quantitative analysis at 50 and 100 µM cadmium concentration revealed the DNA damage with per cent tail DNA as 75.78 ± 1.49 and 94.65 ± 0.95, respectively, in comparison to the control group (8.87 ± 0.48) post 8 h exposure duration. Cadmium caused a substantial decrease in the activity of key steroidogenic enzymes' (3β-HSD and 17β-HSD) along with reduction of testosterone level in testicular tissue. Furthermore, cadmium treatment induced various types of deformities in sperm, altered the Bax/Bcl-2 expression ratio in testicular tissue and thus suggesting the apoptosis-mediated death of testicular cells. Simultaneous quercetin supplementation, however, significantly (p < 0.05) averted the aforementioned cadmium-mediated damage in testicular tissue. Conclusively, the cadmium-induced DNA-damage and decrease in steroidogenic potential results in death of testicular cells via apoptosis, which was significantly counteracted by quercetin co-supplementation, and thus preventing the cadmium-mediated cytotoxicity of testicular cells.",2023,12,30

Population genetics of the Ixodes affinis (Ixodida: Ixodidae) complex in America: new findings and a host-parasite review.,"Ticks are hematophagous ectoparasites associated with a wide range of vertebrate hosts. Within this group, the Ixodidae family stands out, in which the Ixodes genus contains at least 245 species worldwide, from which 55 species are present in the Neotropical region. Ixodes affinis, a tick described in 1899, has a wide distribution from the Southern Cone of America to the United States. However, since its description, morphological variability has been reported among its populations. Furthermore, attempts have been made to clarify its status as a species complex using mitochondrial markers, but mainly in restricted populations of South and Central America. Thus, information related to populations of the transition region between the Neotropical and Nearctic zones is lacking. For these reasons, the objectives of the study were to evaluate the genetic diversity and structure of I. affinis across the Americas and to compile all the published records of I. affinis in America, to elucidate the host-parasite relationships and to identify their geographical distribution. For this, a phylogeny, and AMOVA analyses were performed to assess the genetic structure of samples obtained by field work in South Carolina, USA and Yucatán, Mexico. A total of 86 sequences were retrieved from a fragment of the 16S region. Phylogeny and genetic structure analysis showed four groups that were geographically and genetically related with high branch support and Fst values, all of them statistically significant. The results obtained support the hypothesis that I. affinis it corresponds to a complex of four species, which must be validated through future morphological comparisons.",2023,12,30

Functional Divergence and Origin of the Vertebrate Praja Family.,"The Praja family is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, promoting polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of substrates. It comprises two paralogs, praja1 and praja2. Prior research suggests these paralogs have undergone functional divergence, with examples, such as their distinct roles in neurite outgrowth. However, the specific evolutionary trajectories of each paralog remain largely unexplored preventing mechanistic understanding of functional differences between paralogs. Here, we investigated the phylogeny and divergence of the vertebrate Praja family through molecular evolutionary analysis. Phylogenetic examination of the vertebrate praja revealed that praja1 and praja2 originated from the common ancestor of placentals via gene duplication, with praja1 evolving at twice the rate of praja2 shortly after the duplication. Moreover, a unique evolutionary trajectory for praja1 relative to other vertebrate Praja was indicated, as evidenced by principal component analysis on GC content, codon usage frequency, and amino acid composition. Subsequent motif/domain comparison revealed conserved N terminus and C terminus in praja1 and praja2, together with praja1-specific motifs, including nuclear localization signal and Ala-Gly-Ser repeats. The nuclear localization signal was demonstrated to be functional in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells using deletion mutant, while praja2 was exclusively expressed in the nucleus. These discoveries contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the Praja family's phylogeny and suggest a functional divergence between praja1 and praja2. Specifically, the shift of praja1 into the nucleus implies the degradation of novel substrates located in the nucleus as an evolutionary consequence.",2023,12,29

Sleep problems in children with autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A comparative study and effects on communication skills.,"Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent among children with neurodevelopmental disorders, like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hiperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The first objective of this study is to examine the differences in sleep problems between a group of children with ASD without intellectual disabilities, a group with ADHD and a typically developing (TD) group. A second objective is aimed at analyzing the effects of sleep problems and symptom severity on their communication skills. Participants were 122 children between 7 and 12 years old distributed in three groups: 32 TD children, 47 children with ASD and 43 children with ADHD, matched on age and intelligence. Parents completed different questionnaires that measured sleep disturbances and communication skills. Findings show significant differences between the clinical groups and the TD group in most types of sleep disorders. Moreover, the group with ADHD showed significantly more sleep breathing disorders and hyperhidrosis in comparison with ASD and TD, as well as more total sleep problems. In contrast to ASD, the predictive power of sleep problems on communication difficulties was greater in the group with ADHD. The results of the mediation analysis indicate that in both groups, sleep problems partially mediate the relationship between symptoms and communication. This investigation highlights the need of considering sleep disorders when assessing communication skills in ASD and ADHD, given its indirect influence in this domain. Understanding the sleep dysfunctions of both conditions and their repercussions is crucial to develop adjusted interventions.",2023,12,29

Renal Epithelial Mitochondria: Implications for Hypertensive Kidney Disease.,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 2 U.S. adults have hypertension, and more than 1 in 7 chronic kidney disease. In fact, hypertension is the second leading cause of kidney failure in the United States; it is a complex disease characterized by, leading to, and caused by renal dysfunction. It is well-established that hypertensive renal damage is accompanied by mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress, which are differentially regulated and manifested along the nephron due to the diverse structure and functions of renal cells.

Environmental Enrichment for Stroke and Traumatic Brain Injury: Mechanisms and Translational Implications.,"Acquired brain injuries, such as ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and traumatic brain injury (TBI), can cause severe neurologic damage and even death. Unfortunately, currently, there are no effective and safe treatments to reduce the high disability and mortality rates associated with these brain injuries. However, environmental enrichment (EE) is an emerging approach to treating and rehabilitating acquired brain injuries by promoting motor, sensory, and social stimulation. Multiple preclinical studies have shown that EE benefits functional recovery, including improved motor and cognitive function and psychological benefits mediated by complex protective signaling pathways. This article provides an overview of the enriched environment protocols used in animal models of ischemic stroke, ICH, and TBI, as well as relevant clinical studies, with a particular focus on ischemic stroke. Additionally, we explored studies of animals with stroke and TBI exposed to EE alone or in combination with multiple drugs and other rehabilitation modalities. Finally, we discuss the potential clinical applications of EE in future brain rehabilitation therapy and the molecular and cellular changes caused by EE in rodents with stroke or TBI.

Coplanar MoS<sub>2</sub> -MoTe<sub>2</sub> Heterojunction With the Same Crystal Orientation.,"Two-dimensional (2D) coplanar heterostructure enables high-performance optoelectronic devices, such as p-n heterojunctions. However, realizing site-controllable and shape-specific 2D coplanar heterojunctions composed of two semiconductors with the same crystal orientation still requires the development of new growth methods. Here, a route to fabricate MoS<sub>2</sub> -MoTe<sub>2</sub> coplanar heterojunctions with the same crystal orientation is reported by exploiting the properties of phase transition and atomic rearrangement during the growth of 2H-MoTe<sub>2</sub> . Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy techniques reveal the chemical composition and lattice structure of the heterostructure. Both MoS<sub>2</sub> and MoTe<sub>2</sub> in the heterojunction are single crystals and have the same lattice orientation, and their shapes can be arbitrarily defined by electron beam lithography. Electrical measurements show that the MoS<sub>2</sub> and MoTe<sub>2</sub> channels exhibit n-type and p-type transfer characteristics, respectively. The coplanar epitaxy technology can be used to prepare more coplanar heterostructures with novel device functions.",2023,12,29
3D Flower-like Nanospheres Constructed by Transition Metal Telluride Nanosheets as Sulfur Immobilizers for High-Performance Room-Temperature Na-S Batteries.,"Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries hold immense promise as next-generation energy storage systems, owing to their exceptionally high theoretical capacity, abundant resources, eco-friendliness, and affordability. Nevertheless, their practical application is impeded by the shuttling effect of sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. In this study, an advanced strategy by designing 3D flower-like molybdenum telluride (MoTe<sub>2</sub> ) as an efficient catalyst to promote sulfur redox for RT Na-S batteries is presented. The unique 3D flower-like MoTe<sub>2</sub> effectively prevents NaPS shuttling and simultaneously offers abundant active catalytic sites facilitating polysulfide redox. Consequently, the obtained MoTe<sub>2</sub> /S cathode delivers an outstanding initial reversible capacity of 1015 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.1 C, along with robust cycling stability of retaining 498 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 C after 500 cycles. In addition, pouch cells are fabricated with the MoTe<sub>2</sub> additive to deliver an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 890 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> and remain stable over 40 cycles under practically necessary conditions, demonstrating the potential application in the commercialization of RT Na-S batteries.",2023,12,29
"Radiosynthesis and whole-body distribution in mice of a <sup>18</sup> F-labeled azepino[4,3-b]indole-1-one derivative with multimodal activity for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","Recently, the azepino[4,3-b]indole-1-one derivative 1 showed in vitro nanomolar inhibition against butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), the ChE isoform that plays a role in the progression and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and protects against N-methyl- d-aspartate-induced neuronal toxicity. Three 9-R-substituted (R = F, Br, OMe) congeners were investigated.

Wildlife-vehicle collisions: The disproportionate risk of injury faced by motorcyclists.,"We applied a generalized linear mixed-effects model to determine the factors leading to injuries from wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs). We used the Police database representing WVCs which took place on the Czech road network between 2009 and 2022. The majority of WVCs in Czechia are with roe deer, followed by wild boar, i.e., both relatively small ungulates. Less than 2 % of these encounters ends with an injury to the motor vehicle occupants. We found that the probability of sustaining injury was systematically higher for motorcyclists than for car occupants. The odds of sustaining an injury during WVC were roughly 1600 times higher for motorcyclists than for car occupants. When applying an evading manoeuvre, the odds of sustaining an injury were approximately 68 times higher for car occupants while only 2.3 times higher for motorcyclists compared to a direct hit to an animal. The lack of helmets (for motorcyclists) and missing seat belts (for car occupants) were additional factors which made the outcomes worse for WVCs. While the acceptance of a direct hit (preceded by braking) seems to be a reasonable strategy for car drivers, WVC awareness (including maintaining a lower speed during critical times and places) should be raised among motorcyclists as both manoeuvres are almost comparably dangerous for them.",2023,12,24

Empowering patients as co-researchers in social pharmacy: Lessons learned and practical tips for meaningful partnership and impact.,"Engaging patients as co-researchers in health service research, involving them in the design, planning, and implementation rather than treating them as mere participants, can yield positive outcomes and generate value for patients' health. It also increases patients' health literacy and empowerment, leading to more meaningful studies and substantial research impact. However, deeper levels of engagement as partners throughout the research lifecycle come with ethical and methodological challenges. This commentary provides actionable advice for Patient Engagement and Involvement (PEI) in social pharmacy research through a rapid review of models, frameworks, and guidelines and by gathering lessons from four recent social pharmacy research initiatives conducted in Nordic settings. It also identifies and discusses ethical and methodological challenges to conducting authentic and sustained patient-driven research.

Enhancing lipid peroxidation via radical chain transfer reaction for MRI guided and effective cancer therapy in mice.,"Lipid peroxidation (LPO), the process of membrane lipid oxidation, is a potential new form of cell death for cancer treatment. However, the radical chain reaction involved in LPO is comprised of the initiation, propagation (the slowest step), and termination stages, limiting its effectiveness in vivo. To address this limitation, we introduce the radical chain transfer reaction into the LPO process to target the propagation step and overcome the sluggish rate of lipid peroxidation, thereby promoting endogenous lipid peroxidation and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. Firstly, radical chain transfer agent (CTA-1)/Fe nanoparticles (CTA-Fe NPs-1) was synthesized. Notably, CTA-1 convert low activity peroxyl radicals (ROO·) into high activity alkoxyl radicals (RO·), creating the cycle of free radical oxidation and increasing the propagation of lipid peroxidation. Additionally, CTA-1/Fe ions enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, consume glutathione (GSH), and thereby inactivate GPX-4, promoting the initiation stage and reducing termination of free radical reaction. CTA-Fe NPs-1 induce a higher level of peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in lipid membranes, leading to highly effective treatment in cancer cells. In addition, CTA-Fe NPs-1 could be enriched in tumors inducing potent tumor inhibition and exhibit activatable T<sub>1</sub>-MRI contrast of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In summary, CTA-Fe NPs-1 can enhance intracellular lipid peroxidation by accelerating initiation, propagation, and inhibiting termination step, promoting the cycle of free radical reaction, resulting in effective anticancer outcomes in tumor-bearing mice.",2023,12,19

Sequence-dependent and -independent information in a combined random energy model for protein folding and coding.,"Random energy models (REMs) provide a simple description of the energy landscapes that guide protein folding and evolution. The requirement of a large energy gap between the native structure and unfolded conformations, considered necessary for cooperative, protein-like, folding behavior, indicates that proteins differ markedly from random heteropolymers. It has been suggested, therefore, that natural selection might have acted to choose nonrandom amino acid sequences satisfying this particular condition, implying that a large fraction of possible, unselected random sequences, would not fold to any structure. From an informational perspective, however, this scenario could indicate that protein structures, regarded as messages to be transmitted through a communication channel, would not be efficiently encoded in amino acid sequences, regarded as the communication channel for this transmission, since a large fraction of possible channel states would not be used. Here, we use a combined REM for conformations and sequences, with previously estimated parameters for natural proteins, to explore an alternative possibility in which the appropriate shape of the landscape results mainly from the deviation from randomness of possible native structures instead of sequences. We observe that this situation emerges naturally if the distribution of conformational energies happens to arise from two independent contributions corresponding to sequence-dependent and -independent terms. This construction is consistent with the hypothesis of a protein burial folding code, with native structures being determined by a modest amount of sequence-dependent atomic burial information with sequence-independent constraints imposed by unspecific hydrogen bond formation. More generally, an appropriate combination of sequence-dependent and -independent information accommodates the possibility of an efficient structural encoding with the main physical requirement for folding, providing possible insight not only on the folding process but also on several aspects sequence evolution such as neutral networks, conformational coverage, and de novo gene emergence.",2023,12,29
Evaluating the efficacy and generality of a skill-based approach for promoting universal behavioral readiness.,"Behavioral readiness can take the form of communication and self-control skills during challenging situations that are correlated with the development of problem behavior. A skill-based approach can teach behavioral readiness using procedures that involve synthesized reinforcement, probabilistic reinforcement, and contingency-based delays; however, this approach is commonly used to address severe behavior under specific situations. There is limited research evaluating a skill-based approach to teaching behavioral readiness and addressing emerging problem behavior. Also, it is unclear whether teaching effects under specific situations transfer across other, functionally distinct, situations. We evaluated the generality of a skill-based approach by teaching skills systematically across primary challenging situations involving the interruption of play, presentation of instructions, and removal of reinforcers. Teaching increased communication and self-control skills, and most skills transferred to secondary challenging situations (treatment extension probes) and caregiver-implemented sessions. We discuss challenging situations that required teaching, the generality of teaching, and procedural considerations.",2023,12,29
Evolving Barriers to Clinical Trial Enrollment and Clinical Care in Neuro-oncology in the Face of COVID-19.,"The lack of treatments with durable response in neuro-oncology highlights the critical need for clinical trials to advance patient care. The intersection of relatively low incidence, evolving classification schema, and entrenched community, healthcare provider, and organizational factors have been historic challenges against successful trial enrollment and implementation. The additional need for multidisciplinary, often tertiary-level care, further magnifies latent national and international health inequities with rural and under-served populations. The COVID-19 pandemic both unveiled fundamental weaknesses in historical approaches and prompted the necessity of new approaches and systems for conducting clinical trials. Here, we provide an overview of traditional barriers to clinical trial enrollment in neuro-oncology, the effect of COVID-19 on these barriers, and the discovery of additional systemic weaknesses. Finally, we discuss future directions by reflecting on lessons learned with strategies to broaden access of care and streamline clinical trial integration into clinical practice.",2023,12,29

[The need for a multidimensional assessment in frail patients].,"A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) encompasses medical, psychosocial, and functional aspects that facilitate comprehensive treatment planning and therapy for older adults. It goes beyond a simple screening and typically includes evaluating functionality, mobility, cognition, and emotions, with additional dimensions being relevant based on specific goals. In essence, CGA is suitable for recognizing and evaluating the complexity of frailty and devising suitable interventions.CGA represents a structured way to map the complexity of frail older adults. Employing a multidimensional strategy, it enables the early identification of frailty, facilitating tailored treatment plans, risk assessment and the monitoring of changes over time. A CGA can be conducted in different settings, including acute geriatric wards, in form of a consultation in non-geriatric wards, or directly in outpatient settings and has proven effective in improving care among frail patients.A recent trend in CGA programs involves the use of virtual assessments through telemedicine.

CPA toxicity screening of cryoprotective solutions in rat hearts.,"In clinical practice, donor hearts are transported on ice prior to transplant and discarded if cold ischemia time exceeds ∼5 h. Methods to extend these preservation times are critically needed, and ideally, this storage time would extend indefinitely, enabling improved donor-to-patient matching, organ utilization, and immune tolerance induction protocols. Previously, we demonstrated successful vitrification and rewarming of whole rat hearts without ice formation by perfusion-loading a cryoprotective agent (CPA) solution prior to vitrification. However, these hearts did not recover any beating even in controls with CPA loading/unloading alone, which points to the chemical toxicity of the cryoprotective solution (VS55 in Euro-Collins carrier solution) as the likely culprit. To address this, we compared the toxicity of another established CPA cocktail (VEG) to VS55 using ex situ rat heart perfusion. The CPA exposure time was 150 min, and the normothermic assessment time was 60 min. Using Celsior as the carrier, we observed partial recovery of function (atria-only beating) for both VS55 and VEG. Upon further analysis, we found that the VEG CPA cocktail resulted in 50 % lower LDH release than VS55 (N = 4, p = 0.017), suggesting VEG has lower toxicity than VS55. Celsior was a better carrier solution than alternatives such as UW, as CPA + Celsior-treated hearts spent less time in cardiac arrest (N = 4, p = 0.029). While we showed substantial improvement in cardiac function after exposure to vitrifiable concentrations of CPA by improving both the CPA and carrier solution formulation, further improvements will be required before we achieve healthy cryopreserved organs for transplant.",2023,12,27
The biology of mitochondrial carrier homolog 2.,"The mitochondrial carrier system is in charge of small molecule transport between the mitochondria and the cytoplasm as well as being an integral portion of the core mitochondrial function. One member of the mitochondrial carrier family of proteins, mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2), is characterized as a critical mitochondrial outer membrane protein insertase participating in mitochondrial homeostasis. Accumulating evidence demonstrate that MTCH2 is integrally linked to cell death and mitochondrial metabolism, and its genetic alterations cause a variety of disease phenotypes, ranging from obesity, Alzheimer's disease, and tumor. To provide a comprehensive insight into the current understanding of MTCH2, we present a detailed description of the physiopathological functions of MTCH2, ranging from apoptosis, mitochondrial dynamics, and metabolic homeostasis regulation. Moreover, we summarized the impact of MTCH2 in human diseases, and highlighted tumors, to assess the role of MTCH2 mutations or variable expression on pathogenesis and target therapeutic options.",2023,12,27
Chymase - Independent vascular Ang 1-12/Ang II pathway and TXA<sub>2</sub> generation are involved in endothelial dysfunction in the murine model of heart failure.,"The angiotensin (Ang)-(1-12)/II pathway contributes to cardiac pathology. However, its involvement in the development of peripheral endothelial dysfunction associated with heart failure (HF) remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to characterise the effect of exogenous Ang-(1-12) and its conversion to Ang II on endothelial function using the murine model of HF (Tgαq*44 mice), focusing on the role of chymase and vascular-derived thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> (TXA<sub>2</sub>). Ex vivo myographic assessments of isolated aorta showed impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in late-stage HF in 12-month-old Tgαq*44 mice. However, endothelium-dependent vasodilation was fully preserved in the early stage of HF in 4-month-old Tgαq*44 mice and 4- and 12-month-old FVB mice. Ang-(1-12) impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in 4- and 12-month-old Tgαq*44 mice, that was associated with increased Ang II production. The chymase inhibitor chymostatin did not inhibit this response. Interestingly, TXA<sub>2</sub> production reflected by TXB<sub>2</sub> measurement was upregulated in response to Ang-(1-12) and Ang II in aortic rings isolated from 12-month-old Tgαq*44 mice but not from 4-month-old Tgαq*44 mice or age-matched FVB mice. Furthermore, in vivo magnetic resonance imaging showed that Ang-(1-12) impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the aorta of Tgαq*44 mice and FVB mice. However, this response was inhibited by angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE; perindopril), angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT<sub>1</sub>; losartan), and TXA<sub>2</sub> receptor (TP; picotamide) antagonists in 12-month-old-Tgαq*44 mice only. In conclusion, the chymase-independent vascular Ang-(1-12)/Ang II pathway and subsequent TXA<sub>2</sub> overactivity contribute to systemic endothelial dysfunction in the late stage of HF in Tgαq*44 mice. Therefore, the vascular TXA<sub>2</sub> receptor represents a pharmacotherapeutic target to improve peripheral endothelial dysfunction in chronic HF.",2023,12,27
Paracrine cross-talk between human adipose tissue-derived endothelial cells and perivascular cells accelerates the endothelialization of an electrospun ionomeric polyurethane scaffold.,"The ex vivo endothelialization of small diameter vascular prostheses can prolong their patency. Here, we demonstrate that heterotypic interactions between human adipose tissue-derived endothelial cells and perivascular cells can be exploited to accelerate the endothelialization of an electrospun ionomeric polyurethane scaffold. The scaffold was used to physically separate endothelial cells from perivascular cells to prevent their diffuse neo-intimal hyperplasia and spontaneous tubulogenesis, yet enable their paracrine cross-talk to accelerate the integration of the endothelial cells into a temporally stable endothelial lining of a continuous, elongated, and aligned morphology. Perivascular cells stimulated endothelial basement membrane protein production and suppressed their angiogenic and inflammatory activation to accelerate this biomimetic morphogenesis of the endothelium. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and underscore the value of exploiting heterotypic interactions between endothelial cells and perivascular cells for the fabrication of an endothelial lining intended for small diameter arterial reconstruction. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Adipose tissue is an abundant, accessible, and uniquely dispensable source of endothelial cells and perivascular cells for vascular tissue engineering. While their spontaneous self-assembly into microvascular networks is routinely exploited for the vascularization of engineered tissues, it threatens the temporal stability of an endothelial lining intended for small diameter arterial reconstruction. Here, we demonstrate that an electrospun polyurethane scaffold can be used to physically separate endothelial cells from perivascular cells to prevent their spontaneous capillary morphogenesis, yet enable their cross-talk to promote the formation of a stable endothelium. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of engineering an endothelial lining from human adipose tissue, poising it for the rapid ex vivo endothelialization of small diameter vascular prostheses in an autologous, patient-specific manner.",2023,12,28
Moderate Replacement of Fish Oil with Palmitic Acid-Stimulated Mitochondrial Fusion Promotes β-oxidation by Mfn2 Interacting with Cpt1α via Its GTPase-domain.,"The mitochondrial matrix serves as the principal locale for the process of fatty acids (FAs) β-oxidation. Preserving the integrity and homeostasis of mitochondria, which is accomplished through ongoing fusion and fission events, is of paramount importance for the effective execution of FAs β-oxidation. There has been no investigation to date into whether and how mitochondrial fusion directly enhances FAs β-oxidation. The underlying mechanism of a balanced FAs ratio favoring hepatic lipid homeostasis remains largely unclear. To address such gaps, the present study was conducted to investigate the mechanism through which a balanced dietary FAs ratio enhances hepatic FAs β-oxidation. The investigation specifically focused on the involvement of Mfn2-mediated mitochondrial fusion in the regulation of Cpt1α in this process. In the present study, the yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco), recognized as a model organism for lipid metabolism, were subjected to eight weeks of in vivo feeding with six distinct diets featuring varying FAs ratios. Additionally, in vitro experiments were conducted to inhibit Mfn2-mediated mitochondrial fusion in isolated hepatocytes, achieved through the transfection of hepatocytes with si-mfn2. Further, deletion mutants for both Mfn2 and Cpt1α were constructed to elucidate the critical regions responsible for the interactions between these two proteins within the system. The key findings were: 1. Substituting palmitic acid (PA) for fish oil (FO) proved to be enhanced in reducing hepatic lipid accumulation. This beneficial effect was primarily attributed to the activation of mitochondrial FAs β-oxidation; 2. The balanced replacement of PA stimulated Mfn2-mediated mitochondrial fusion by diminishing Mfn2 ubiquitination, thereby enhancing its protein retention within the mitochondria; 3. Mfn2-mediated mitochondrial fusion promoted FAs β-oxidation through direct interaction between Mfn2 and Cpt1α via its GTPase-domains, which is essential for the maintenance of Cpt1 activity. Notably, the present research results unveil a previously undisclosed mechanism wherein Mfn2-mediated mitochondrial fusion promotes FAs β-oxidation by directly augmenting the capacity for FA transport into mitochondria (MT), in addition to expanding the mitochondrial matrix. This underscores the pivotal role of mitochondrial fusion in preserving hepatic lipid homeostasis. The present results further confirm that these mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved, extending their relevance from fish to mammals.",2023,12,27
Tunnel engineering of gas-converting enzymes for inhibitor retardation and substrate acceleration.,"Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), formate dehydrogenase (FDH), hydrogenase (H2ase), and nitrogenase (N2ase) are crucial enzymatic catalysts that facilitate the conversion of industrially significant gases such as CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>. The tunnels in the gas-converting enzymes serve as conduits for these low molecular weight gases to access deeply buried catalytic sites. The identification of the substrate tunnels is imperative for comprehending the substrate selectivity mechanism underlying these gas-converting enzymes. This knowledge also holds substantial value for industrial applications, particularly in addressing the challenges associated with separation and utilization of byproduct gases. In this comprehensive review, we delve into the emerging field of tunnel engineering, presenting a range of approaches and analyses. Additionally, we propose methodologies for the systematic design of enzymes, with the ultimate goal of advancing protein engineering strategies.",2023,12,27

Role of Hepatic Stellate and Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells in a Human Primary Cell Three-Dimensional Model of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an inflammatory and fibrotic liver disease that has reached epidemic proportions and has no approved pharmacologic therapies. Research and drug development efforts are hampered by inadequate preclinical models. This research describes a three-dimensional bioprinted liver tissue model of NASH built using primary human hepatocytes and nonparenchymal liver cells (hepatic stellate cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells) from either healthy or NASH donors. Three-dimensional tissues bioprinted with cells sourced from diseased patients show a NASH phenotype, including fibrosis. More important, this NASH phenotype occurs without the addition of disease-inducing agents. Bioprinted tissues composed entirely of healthy cells exhibit significantly less evidence of disease. The role of individual cell types in driving the NASH phenotype was examined by producing chimeric bioprinted tissues composed of healthy cells together with the addition of one or more diseased nonparenchymal cell types. These experiments reveal a role for both hepatic stellate and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in the disease process. This model represents a fully human system with potential to detect clinically active targets and eventually therapies.",2023,12,28
Influence of starch silylation on the structures and properties of starch/epoxidized soybean oil-based bioplastics.,"The present work systematically investigated the influence of starch silylation on the structures and properties of starch/epoxidized soybean oil-based bioplastics. Silylated starch was synthesized using starch particles (SP-ST) or gelatinized starch (SG-ST) under different silane hydrolysis pHs. Due to the appearance of -NH<sub>2</sub> groups and lower OH wavenumbers, SP-ST obtained at pH 5 showed higher silylation degree and stronger hydrogen bond interaction with epoxidized soybean oils (ESO) than that at pH 11. The morphology analysis revealed better interfacial compatibility of ESO and SP-ST. The tensile strength of the samples containing SP-ST increased by 51.91 % than the control, emphasizing the enhanced interaction within the bioplastics. However, tensile strength of the bioplastics with SG-ST decreased by 59.56 % due to their high moisture contents from unreacted silanes. Additionally, the bioplastics with SG-ST exhibited an obvious reduction of thermal stability and an increase in water solubility because of the presence of unreacted APMS. The bioplastic degradation was not prevented by starch silylation except high pH. The bioplastics showed the most desirable tensile properties, thermal stability, and water solubility when starch was surface-modified with silanes hydrolyzed at pH 5. These outcomes made the fabricated bioplastics strong candidates for petroleum-based plastics for packaging applications.",2023,12,27

Hydrogen peroxide is not generated intracellularly in human neural spheroids during ischemia-reperfusion.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered a primary source of damage during ischemic stroke. However, the precise timing of ROS production (during hypoxia or reperfusion) remains unclear. Cellular 3D spheroids are often proposed as an optimal alternative to both 2D cell cultures and animal models in modeling disease conditions. Here we report live imaging of hydrogen peroxide dynamics during the acute phase of hypoxia and reperfusion in human iPSC-derived neural spheroids, stably expressing fluorescent biosensor HyPer7. Contrary to previous reports, we did not observe a hydrogen peroxide production burst neither during hypoxia nor in course of reperfusion. Our data suggest either lack of oxidative stress during ischemia-reperfusion in spheroids or existence of different mechanisms of oxidative damage.",2023,12,27

Minimum Concentrations of Slow Pyrolysis Paper and Walnut Hull Cyclone Biochars Needed to Inactivate Escherichia coli O157:H7 in Soil.,"Antimicrobial properties of biochar have been attributed to its ability to inactivate foodborne pathogens in soil, to varying degrees. High concentrations of biochar have reduced E. coli O157:H7 in soil and dairy manure compost, based on alkaline pH. Preliminary studies evaluating 31 different biochars determined that two slow pyrolysis biochars (paper biochar and walnut hull cyclone biochar) were the most effective at inactivating E. coli in soil. A study was conducted to determine the lowest percentages of paper and walnut hull cyclone biochars needed to reduce E. coli O157:H7 in soil. A model soil was adjusted to 17.75% moisture and the two types of biochar were added at concentrations of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5%. Nontoxigenic E. coli O157:H7 were inoculated into soil at 6.84 log CFU/g and stored for up to 6 weeks at 21°C. Mean E. coli O157:H7 counts were 6.01-6.86 log CFU/g at all weeks between 1 and 6 in soil-only positive control samples. Populations in all soil amended with 1.0 and 1.5% of either type of biochar (as well as 2.0% of the walnut hull biochar), resulted in ≤ 0.68 log reductions at week 6, when compared with positive controls. All other concentrations (i.e., ≥ 2.0% paper and ≥ 2.5% walnut hull) inactivated ≥ 2.7 log at all weeks between 1 and 6 (p < 0.05). At the end of 6 weeks, E. coli O157:H7 declined by 2.84 log in 2.0% paper biochar samples, while concentrations of between 2.5 and 6.5% paper biochar completely inactivated E. coli O157:H7, as determined by spiral plating, at weeks 5 and 6. In contrast, 2.0% walnut hull biochar lowered populations by only 0.38 log at week 6, although 2.5-6.5% concentrations of walnut hull biochar resulted in complete inactivation at all weeks between 3 and 6, as assessed by spiral plating. In summary, ≥ 2.5% paper or walnut hull biochar reduced ≥ 5.0 log of E. coli O157:H7 during the 6-week storage period, which we attribute to high soil alkalinity. Amended at a 2.5% concentration, the pH of soil with paper or walnut hull biochar was 10.67 and 10.06, respectively. Results from this study may assist growers in the use of alkaline biochar for inactivating E. coli O157:H7 in soil.",2023,12,27
Evaluation of ELISA Test Kits for Detection of Milk Protein in Frying Oil Treated at Different Temperatures.,"Milk is a common ingredient in fried foods. Allergen cross-contact can occur through reuse of frying oil. To enable assessment of the allergy risk of reused oil, methods for quantification of milk protein in oil are needed. This study evaluated four commercial ELISA test kits in comparison with the 660 nm total protein assay for detection of milk protein in oil after frying. Corn oil spiked with nonfat or whole milk powder were fried at 150°C or 180°C for 3 min and were analyzed by ELISA kits either directly or after pre-extraction with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween (PBST). All four ELISA kits performed well in quantifying milk protein in unheated oil, achieving normalized recoveries of 72.1%-115.9% compared with that determined in reference solutions (PBST spiked with nonfat or whole milk powder, 100%). Frying lowered the amount of protein detected, but the extent of reduction differed between test kits. In nonfat milk powder-spiked oil fried at 150°C, normalized recoveries determined by Veratox Total Milk and BioKits BLG Assay (49.9% and 43.6%, respectively) were higher than that determined by the 660 nm assay (25.4%). Normalized recoveries determined by ELISA Systems Casein and Beta-Lactoglobulin (BLG) kits were substantially lower (9.7% and 2.4%, respectively). In samples fried under typical frying temperature (180°C), very little protein (0.1%-7.4%) was detected. Inclusion of PBST pre-extraction improved the detection of the two test kits targeting BLG but lowered the level of protein detected by Veratox and ELISA Systems Casein in fried samples. Overall, the ELISA kits evaluated could effectively quantify milk protein in unheated oil without the need to remove the oil phase prior to analysis. Heat treatment was the key factor negatively affecting protein quantitation. Such impact needs to be considered when ELISA test results are used for assessing the allergy risk of reused frying oil.",2023,12,27
N-nitrosodimethylamine exposure to zebrafish embryos/larvae causes cardiac and spinal developmental toxicity.,"N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), one of the new nitrogen-containing disinfection by-products, is potentially cytotoxic, genotoxic, and carcinogenic. Its potential toxicological effects have attracted a wide range of attention, but the mechanism is still not sufficiently understood. To better understand the toxicological mechanisms of NDMA, zebrafish embryos were exposed to NDMA from 3 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 120hpf. Mortality and malformation were significantly increased, and hatching rate, heart rate, and swimming behavior were decreased in the exposure groups. The result indicated that NDMA exposure causes cardiac and spinal developmental toxicity. mRNA levels of genes involved in the apoptotic pathway, including p53, bax, and bcl-2 were significantly affected by NDMA exposure. Moreover, the genes associated with spinal and cardiac development (myh6, myh7, nkx2.5, eph, bmp2b, bmp4, bmp9, run2a, and run2b) were significantly downregulated after treatment with NDMA. Wnt and TGF-β signaling pathways, crucial for the development of diverse tissues and organs in the embryo and the establishment of the larval spine, were also significantly disturbed by NDMA treatment. In summary, the disinfection by-product, NDMA, exhibits spinal and cardiac developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryos, providing helpful information for comprehensive analyses and a better understanding the mechanism of its toxicity.",2023,12,27
Crystal structure of the GH-46 subclass III chitosanase from Bacillus circulans MH-K1 in complex with chitotetraose.,"Chitosanases (EC 3.2.1.132) hydrolyze chitosan which is a polymer of glucosamine (GlcN) linked by β - 1,4 bonds, and show cleavage specificity against partially acetylated chitosan containing N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. Chitosanases' structural underpinnings for cleavage specificity and the conformational switch from open to closed structures are still a mystery.",2023,12,27
Downregulation of PDZK1 by TGF-β1 promotes renal fibrosis via inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition of renal tubular cells.,"Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of renal tubular cells promotes renal fibrosis and the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). PDZ domain-containing 1 (PDZK1) is highly expressed in renal tubular epithelial cells; however, its role in TGF-β1-induced EMT remains poorly understood. The present study showed that PDZK1 expression was extremely downregulated in fibrotic mouse kidneys and its negative correlation with TGF-β1 expression and the degree of renal fibrosis. In addition, TGF-β1 downregulated the mRNA expression of PDZK1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in vitro. The downregulation of PDZK1 exacerbated TGF-β1-induced EMT upon oxidative stress, while the overexpression of PDZK1 had the converse effect. Subsequent investigations demonstrated that TGF-β1 downregulated PDZK1 expression via p38 MAPK or PI3K/AKT signaling in vitro, but independently of ERK/JNK MAPK signaling. Meanwhile, inhibition of the p38/JNK MAPK or PI3K/AKT signaling using chemical inhibitors restored the PDZK1 expression, mitigated renal fibrosis, and elevated renal levels of endogenous antioxidants carnitine and ergothioneine in adenine-induced CKD mice. These findings provide the first evidence suggesting a negative correlation between PDZK1 and renal fibrosis, and identifying PDZK1 as a novel suppressor of renal fibrosis in CKD through ameliorating oxidant stress.",2023,12,27
Post-translational secretion stress regulation in Bacillus subtilis is controlled by intra- and extracellular proteases.,"The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is a prolific producer of industrial enzymes that are effectively harvested from the fermentation broth. However, the high capacity of B. subtilis for protein secretion has so far not been exploited to the full due to particular bottlenecks, including product degradation by extracellular proteases and counterproductive secretion stress responses. To unlock the Bacillus secretion pathway for difficult-to-produce proteins, various cellular interventions have been explored, including genome engineering. Our previous research has shown a superior performance of genome-reduced B. subtilis strains in the production of staphylococcal antigens compared to the parental strain 168. This was attributed, at least in part, to redirected secretion stress responses, including the presentation of elevated levels of the quality control proteases HtrA and HtrB that also catalyse protein folding. Here we show that this relates to the elimination of two homologous serine proteases, namely the cytosolic protease AprX and the extracellular protease AprE. This unprecedented posttranslational regulation of secretion stress effectors, like HtrA and HtrB, by the concerted action of cytosolic and extracellular proteases has important implications for the biotechnological application of microbial cell factories. In B. subtilis, this conclusion is underscored by extracellular degradation of the staphylococcal antigen IsaA by both AprX and AprE. Extracellular activity of the cytosolic protease AprX is remarkable since it shows that not only extracellular, but also intracellular proteases impact extracellular product levels. We therefore conclude that intracellular proteases represent new targets for improved recombinant protein production in microbial cell factories like B. subtilis.",2023,12,27
The molecular response of Mytilus coruscus mantle to shell damage under acute acidified sea water revealed by iTRAQ based quantitative proteomic analysis.,"Mytilus coruscus is an economically important marine bivalve that lives in estuarine sea areas with seasonal coastal acidification and frequently suffers shell injury in the natural environment. However, the molecular responses and biochemical properties of Mytilus under these conditions are not fully understood. In the present study, we employed tandem mass spectrometry combined with isobaric tagging to identify differentially expressed proteins in the mantle tissue of M. coruscus under different short-term treatments, including shell-complete mussels raised in normal seawater (pH 8.1), shell-damaged mussels raised in normal seawater (pH 8.1), and acidified seawater (pH 7.4). A total of 2694 proteins were identified in the mantle, and analysis of their relative abundance from the three different treatments revealed alterations in the proteins involved in immune regulation, oxidation-reduction processes, protein folding and processing, energy provision, and cytoskeleton. The results obtained by quantitative proteomic analysis of the mantle allowed us to delineate the molecular strategies adopted by M. coruscus in the shell repair process in acidified environments, including an increase in proteins involved in oxidation-reduction processes, protein processing, and cell growth at the expense of proteins involved in immune capacity and energy metabolism. SIGNIFICANCE: The impact of global ocean acidification on calcifying organisms has become a major ecological and environmental problem in the world. Mytilus coruscus is an economically important marine bivalve living in estuary sea area with seasonal coastal acidification, and frequently suffering shell injury in natural environment. Molecular responses of M coruscus under the shell damage and acute acidification is still largely unknown. For this reason, iTRAQ based quantitative proteomic and histological analysis of the mantle from M. coruscus under shell damage and acute acidification were performed, for revealing the proteomic response and possible adaptation mechanism of Mytilus under combined shell damage and acidified sea water, and understanding how the mussel mantle implement a shell-repair process under acidified sea water. Our study provides important data for understanding the shell repair process and proteomic response of Mytilus under ocean acidification, and providing insights into potential adaptation of mussels to future global change.",2023,12,27
Recent advances in electrospinning-nanofiber materials used in advanced oxidation processes for pollutant degradation.,"Electrospun nanofiber membranes have emerged as a novel catalyst, demonstrating exceptional efficacy in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the degradation of organic pollutants. Their superior performance can be attributed to their substantial specific surface area, high porosity, ease of modification, rapid recovery, and unparalleled chemical stability. This paper aims to comprehensively explore the progressive applications and underlying mechanisms of electrospun nanofibers in AOPs, which include Fenton-like processes, photocatalysis, catalytic ozonation, and persulfate oxidation. A detailed discussion on the mechanism and efficiency of the catalytic process, which is influenced by the primary components of the electrospun catalyst, is presented. Additionally, the paper examines how concentration, viscosity, and molecular weight affect the characteristics of the spinning materials and seeks to provide a thorough understanding of electrospinning technology to enhance water treatment methods. The review proposes that electrospun nanofiber membranes hold significant potential for enhancing water treatment processes using advanced oxidation methods. This is attributed to their advantageous properties and the tunable nature of the electrospinning process, paving the way for advancements in water treatment through AOPs.",2023,12,27
Association between heart failure and arteriovenous access patency in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.,"Heart disease and chronic kidney disease are often comorbid conditions due to shared risk factors including diabetes and hypertension. However, the effect of congestive heart failure on arteriovenous fistula and graft patency rates is poorly understood. We hypothesize preexisting heart failure may diminish blood flow to the developing AV fistula and worsen patency.",2023,12,27
Optimizing pharmaceutical management of clinical trials.,The clinical trials pharmacists have an essential role in managing the pharmaceutical part of interventional studies.

Green and blue space exposure and non-communicable disease related hospitalizations: A systematic review.,"The global increase in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) presents a critical public health concern. Emerging evidence suggests that exposure to natural environments may reduce the risk of developing NCDs through multiple pathways. The present systematic review aims to synthesize and evaluate the observational evidence regarding associations between exposure to green and blue spaces and hospital admissions related to NCDs. A comprehensive literature search strategy was conducted in Embase (Ovid), PubMed, and Web of Science. The risk of bias and quality of the evidence were assessed using The Navigation Guide methodology, an approach specifically designed for environmental health research. Of 3060 search results, 17 articles were included. Notably, the majority of the studies (n = 14; 82.4%) were published from 2020 onwards. Most studies were conducted in the United States (n = 6; 35.3%) and China (n = 4; 23.5%). Exposure to green spaces was assessed through all studies, while only three included blue spaces. In terms of study design, cohort design was employed in nearly half of the studies (n = 8; 47.1%), followed by case-crossover design (n = 3, 17.6%). Over 75% of the included studies (n = 13) had a high or probably high rating in the risk of bias assessment. The studies encompassed diverse NCD outcome domains; cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (n = 10), respiratory diseases (RSDs) (n = 2), heat-related diseases (n = 1), metabolic diseases (n = 2), cancer (n = 1), neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) (n = 2), and mental health disorders (n = 2). The present review suggests that a clear link between blue space exposure and NCD hospital admissions is not evident. However, exposure to green spaces appears to predominantly have a protective effect, although the direction of the association varies across different outcome domains. The heterogeneity among the outcome domains together with the limited number of studies, emphasizes the need for more robust evidence.",2023,12,27
"Phytochemical, bactericidal, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of various extracts from Pongamia pinnata and functional groups characterization by FTIR and HPLC analyses.","The present research looked into possible biomedical applications of Pongamia pinnata leaf extract. The first screening of the phytochemical profile showed that the acetone extract had more phytochemicals than the other solvent extracts. These included more saponins, proteins, phenolic compounds, tannins, glycosides, flavonoids, steroids, and sugar. The P. pinnata acetone extract exhibited highest antibacterial activity against C. diphtheriae. The bactericidal activity was found in the following order: C. diphtheria (14 mm) > P. aeruginosa (10 mm) > S. flexneri (9 mm) > S. marcescens (7 mm) > S. typhi (7 mm) > S. epidermidis (7 mm) > S. boydii (6 mm) > S. aureus (3 mm) at 10 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> concentration. MIC value of 240 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> and MBC is 300 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> of concentration with 7 colonies against C. diphtheriae was noticed in acetone extract. Acetone extract of P. pinnata was showed highest percentage of inhibition (87.5 %) at 625 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> concentrations by DPPH method. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory activity showed the fine albumin denaturation as 76% as well as anti-lipoxygenase was found as 61% at 900 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> concentrations correspondingly. FT-IR analysis was used to determine the functional groups of compounds with bioactive properties. The qualitative examination of selected plants through HPLC yielded significant peak values determined by intervals through the peak value. In an acetone extract of P. pinnata, 9 functional groups were identified. These findings concluded that the acetone extract has high pharmaceutical value, but more in-vivo research is needed to assess its potential.",2023,12,27
Green space and its types can attenuate the associations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and its components with prediabetes and diabetes-- a multicenter cross-sectional study from eastern China.,"The effect of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) components on prediabetes and diabetes is of concern, but the evidence is limited and the specific role of different green space types remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the relationship of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and its components with prediabetes and diabetes as well as the potential health benefits of different types and combinations of green spaces.",2023,12,27
The disruption of circadian rhythmicity of gene expression in the hippocampus and associated structures in Gria2<sup>R/R</sup> mice; a comparison with C57BL/6J and Adar2<sup>-/-</sup> mice strains.,"Adar2<sup>-/-</sup> mice are a widely used model for studying the physiological consequences of reduced RNA editing. These mice are viable only when the Q/R editing site of the Gria2 subunit of the AMPA receptor is constitutively mutated to the codon for arginine, and Gria2<sup>R/R</sup> mice often serve as the sole control for Adar2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our study aimed to investigate whether ADAR2 inactivity and the Gria2<sup>R/R</sup> phenotype affect the rhythmicity of the circadian clock gene pattern and the expression of Gria1 and Gria2 subunits in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), hippocampus, parietal cortex and liver. Our data show that Gria2<sup>R/R</sup> mice completely lost circadian rhythmicity in the hippocampus compared to Adar2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Compared to C57BL/6J mice, the expression profiles in the hippocampus and parietal cortex of Gria2<sup>R/R</sup> mice differ to the same extent as in Adar2<sup>-/-</sup>. No alterations were detected in the circadian profiles in the livers. These data suggest that the natural gradual postnatal increase in the editing of the Q/R site of the Gria2 subunit may be important for the development of circadian clockwork in some brain structures, and the use of Gria2<sup>R/R</sup> mice as the only control to Adar2<sup>-/-</sup> mice in the experiments dependent on the hippocampus and parietal cortex should therefore be considered.",2023,12,27
Development and Validation of an Electronic Adverse Event Model for Patient Safety Surveillance in Interventional Radiology.,Comprehensive adverse event (AE) surveillance programs in interventional radiology (IR) are rare.

The MR1/MAIT cell axis in CNS diseases.,"Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a subpopulation of innate-like T cells that can be found throughout the body, predominantly in mucosal sites, the lungs and in the peripheral blood. MAIT cells recognize microbial-derived vitamin B (e.g., riboflavin) metabolite antigens that are presented by the major histocompatibility complex class I-like protein, MR1, found on a variety of cell types in the periphery and the CNS. Since their original discovery, MAIT cells have been studied predominantly in their roles in diseases in the periphery; however, it was not until the early 2000 s that these cells were first examined for their contributions to disorders of the CNS, with the bulk of the work being done within the past few years. Currently, the MR1/MAIT cell axis has been investigated in only a few neurological diseases including, multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, brain cancer/tumors, ischemia, cerebral palsy, general aging and, most recently, Alzheimer's disease. Each of these diseases demonstrates a role for this under-studied innate immune axis in its neuropathology. Together, they highlight the importance of studying the MR1/MAIT cell axis in CNS disorders. Here, we review the contributions of the MR1/MAIT cell axis in the progression or remission of these neurological diseases. This work has shed some light in terms of potentially exploiting the MR1/MAIT cell axis in novel therapeutic applications.",2023,12,27
Extensively drug-resistant Enterobacter ludwigii co-harboring mcr-9 and a multicopy of bla<sub>IMP-1</sub> in South Korea.,"In this study, we describe an Enterobacter ludwigii clinical isolate that is resistant to both carbapenems and colistin in South Korea. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that E. ludwigii CRE2104-31 was non-susceptible to all tested antibiotics except fosfomycin. Whole genome sequencing identified a 323-kbp IncHI2 plasmid, pCRE2104-31a, that was co-harboring mcr-9.1 and bla<sub>IMP-1</sub>. In comparison with other full plasmids, pCRE2104-31a exhibited the closest similarity to a plasmid from the Klebsiella pneumoniae strain CNR48 from France, with 19.9% query coverage and 99% identity. Notably, we observed five tandem repeats of bla<sub>IMP-1</sub> and aac(6')-Il genes, accompanied by multiple attCs within a class I integron on the Tn402-like transposon. The unit of bla<sub>IMP-1</sub>-attC-aac(6')-Il-attC might have accumulated due to multiple convergent events. In addition to mcr-9.1 and bla<sub>IMP-1,</sub> various other antibiotic resistance-associated genes were identified in the plasmid, as follows: bla<sub>TEM-1B</sub>, aph(3')-I, aph(3')-Ia, aac(6')-Il, aac(6')-IIc, aac(6')-IIa, aph(6)-Id, aph(3'')-Ib, aadA2b, aac(6')-Ib3, sul, dfrA19, qnrB2, aac(6')-Ib-cr, ere(A), and qacE. A conjugation assay showed that the mcr-9.1/bla<sub>IMP-1</sub>-co-bearing plasmid was self-transmissible to E. coli J53. However, colistin and carbapenem resistance could not be transferred to E. coli due to high incompatibility. The convergence of mcr and carbapenemase genes is thought to be host-dependent among Enterobacteriaceae. The emergence of extensively drug-resistant E. ludwigii co-harboring mcr-9.1 and a multicopy of bla<sub>IMP-1</sub> would pose a significant threat within the compatible Enterobacteriaceae.",2023,12,27
Genotype-phenotype correlation in Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa: signposts to severity.,"Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis with a broad spectrum of phenotypes. Current genotype-phenotype paradigms are insufficient to accurately predict JEB subtype and characteristics from genotype, particularly for splice site mutations, which account for over a fifth of disease-causing mutations in JEB. This study evaluated genetic and clinical findings from a JEB cohort, investigating genotype-phenotype correlations through bioinformatic analyses and comparison with previously reported mutations. Eighteen unique mutations in LAMB3, LAMA3, LAMC2 or COL17A1 were identified from seventeen individuals. Seven had severe JEB, nine intermediate JEB and one laryngo-onycho-cutaneous syndrome. Seven mutations were previously unreported. Deep phenotyping was completed for all intermediate JEB cases and demonstrated substantial variation between individuals. Splice site mutations underwent analysis with SpliceAI, a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence tool, in order to predict resultant transcripts. Predicted functional effects included exon skipping and cryptic splice site activation, which provided potential explanations for disease severity and in most cases correlated with lamimin-332 immunofluorescence. RT-PCR was performed for one case to investigate resultant transcripts produced from the splice site mutation. This study expands the JEB genomic and phenotypic landscape. AI tools show potential for predicting functional effects of splice site mutations and may identify candidates for confirmatory laboratory investigation. Investigation of RNA transcripts will help to further elucidate genotype-phenotype correlations for novel mutations.",2023,12,27
SARS-CoV-2 perinatal transmission and neonatal outcomes across four different waves of COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide prospective cohort study from the Italian Society of Neonatology.,To describe how SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of delivery affected maternal and neonatal outcomes across four major waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.,2023,12,27
Prolonged exposure to lactate causes TREK1 channel clustering in rat hippocampal astrocytes.,"Increased concentrations of lactate (15-30 mM) are associated with and found to be neuroprotective in various brain pathophysiology. In our earlier studies we showed that high levels of lactate can increase TREK1 channel activity and expression within 1 h. TREK1 channels are two pore domain leak potassium ion channels that are upregulated during cerebral ischemia, epilepsy and other brain pathologies. They play a prominent neuroprotective role against excitotoxicity. Although it has been previously shown that chronic application of lactate (6 h) causes increased gene transcription and protein expression, we observe clustering of TREK1 channels that is dependent on time of exposure (3-6 h) and concentration of lactate (15-30 mM). Using immunofluorescence techniques and image analysis, we show that the clustering of TREK1 channels is dependent on the actin cytoskeletal network of the astrocytes. Clustering of TREK1 channels can augment astrocytic functions during pathophysiological conditions and have significant implications in lactate mediated neuroprotection.",2023,12,27
A multiclass extreme gradient boosting model for evaluation of transcriptomic biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease prediction.,"Patients with young-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) (before the age of 50 years old) often lack obvious imaging changes and amyloid protein deposition, which can lead to misdiagnosis with other cognitive impairments.

"Sample preparation, analytical characterization, monitoring, risk assessment and treatment of naphthenic acids in industrial wastewater and surrounding water impacted by unconventional petroleum production.","Industrial extraction of unconventional petroleum results in notable volumes of oil sands process water (OSPW), containing elevated concentrations of naphthenic acids (NAs). The presence of NAs represents an intricate amalgamation of dissolved organic constituents, thereby presenting a notable hurdle for the domain of environmental analytical chemistry. There is growing concern about monitoring the potential seepage of OSPW NAs into nearby groundwater and river water. This review summarizes recent studies on sample preparation, characterization, monitoring, risk assessment, and treatment of NAs in industrial wastewater and surrounding water. Sample preparation approaches, such as liquid-liquid extraction, solid phase microextraction, and solid phase extraction, are crucial in isolating chemical standards, performing molecular level analysis, assessing aquatic toxicity, monitoring, and treating OSPW. Instrument techniques for NAs analysis were reviewed to cover different injection modes, ionization sources, and mass analyzers. Recent studies of transfer and transformation of NAs provide insights to differentiate between anthropogenic and natural bitumen-derived sources of NAs. In addition, related risk assessment and treatment studies were also present for elucidation of environmental implication and reclamation strategies. The synthesis of the current state of scientific knowledge presented in this review targets government regulators, academic researchers, and industrial scientists with interests spanning analytical chemistry, toxicology, and wastewater management.",2023,12,27
Solute depletion and reduced hydrological connectivity in subarctic patterned peatlands disturbed by mine dewatering.,"Patterned bog and fen peatlands of the Hudson Bay Lowlands, which form one of the largest continuous peatland complexes in the world, are globally significant stores of carbon and important water conveyance and storage features on the landscape. However, expansion of resource exploration and extraction combined with warmer temperatures associated with climate change may result in reduced water availability to these peatland complexes, potentially disrupting peatland hydrological connectivity and hydrogeochemical cycling. A case study on the effects of reduced water availability on peatland hydrological and geochemical function was conducted near the De Beers Victor Diamond Mine, located 90 km west of Attawapiskat. Active dewatering occurred here over a 12-year period (2007-2019) during which a 1.5 km transect was monitored within the mine impacted radius. Hydrological (streamflow and groundwater levels) and chemical (porewater and surface water samples) parameters were collected at the impacted transect and two nearby unimpacted reference sites. Results demonstrated that impacted peatlands had depleted water storage and spent an average of 50 % less time hydrologically connected than unimpacted peatlands. By the end of the study period, increasingly depleted water storage within the dewatering radius resulted in disproportionately lower flowrates in two tributaries downgradient of the mine-impacted peatlands when compared with the reference sites. Moreover, diminished water storage allowed solute-depleted precipitation to reach greater depths within the peat profile, while stronger downwards gradients suppressed upwards flow into fens, limiting the amount of solute-enriched water reaching the surface. The recovery of fen solute concentrations will be a prolonged process (i.e., decades to centuries) due to the slow rate of upwards diffusion, which may result in the transition of these systems towards ombrotrophic bogs. Further studies should focus on the susceptibility of these impacted systems to further reductions in water availability due to climate change.",2023,12,27
Contaminants of emerging concern reduction and microbial community characterization across a three-barrier advanced water treatment system.,"This research investigated the removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and characterized the microbial community across an advanced water treatment (AWT) train consisting of Coagulation/Flocculation/Clarification/Granular Media Filtration (CFCGMF), Ozone-Biological Activated Carbon Filtration (O3/BAC), Granular Activated Carbon filtration, Ultraviolet Disinfection, and Cartridge Filtration (GAC/UV/CF). The AWT train successfully met the goals of CECs and bulk organics removal. The microbial community at each treatment step of the AWT train was characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform generated from DNA extracted from liquid and solid (treatment media) samples taken along the treatment train. Differences in the microbial community structure were observed. The dominant operational taxonomic units (OTU) decreased along the treatment train, but the treatment steps did impact the microbial community composition downstream of each unit process. These results provide insights into microbial ecology in advanced water treatment systems, which are influenced and shaped by each treatment step, the microbial community interactions, and their potential metabolic contribution to CECs degradation.",2023,12,27
Unveiling the presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals in northern French soils: Land cover variability and implications.,"Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are chemicals that can be found in the environment and have adverse effects on human health by mimicking, perturbing and blocking the function of hormones. They are commonly studied in water surfaces, rarely in soils, although it can be an important source of their presence in the environment. Their detection in soils is analytically challenging to quantify, hence the lack of known background concentrations found in the literature. This scientific research aimed to detect EDCs in soils by analyzing 240 soil samples using an optimized protocol of double extraction and analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The optimized protocol allowed for very sensitive detection of the targeted compounds. The results showed a high concentration of 29.391 ng/g of 17β-estradiol in soils and 47.16 ng/g for 17α-ethinylestradiol. Testosterone and Progesterone were detected at a highest of 1.02 and 6.58 ng/g, respectively. The ∑EDCs which included estrogens, progesterone, testosterone and Bisphenol A was found at an average of 22.72 ± 35.46 ng/g in the study area. The results of this campaign showed a heterogeneous geographic distribution of the EDCs compounds in the different zones of study. Additionally, the study conducted a comparison of the concentration of EDCs in different land covers including urban areas, agricultural lands, grasslands and forests. We observed a significant difference between forests and other land covers (p < 0.0001) for 17α-ethinylestradiol, estriol, and progesterone. This presence of EDCs in forest lands is not yet understood and requires further studies concerning its origins, its fate and its effect on human health. This study is the first large-scale sampling campaign targeting EDCs in soils in Europe and the second in the world. It is also the first to assess the concentrations of these compounds based on different land covers.",2023,12,28
The intestinal microbiota exerts a sex-specific influence on neuroinflammation in a Parkinson's disease mouse model.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by chronic and progressive symptoms; it is more prevalent in men than in women. The sex-specific influence of the intestinal microbiota has been associated with some neurodegenerative diseases, but the relationship with PD is currently unclear. In this study, we treated mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to establish a PD mouse model, and we utilised an antibiotic cocktail (Abx) to deplete the intestinal microbiota to evaluate the influence of the intestinal microbiota on male and female PD mice. MPTP treatment obviously caused bradykinesia and low mobility in female and male mice. Meanwhile, Abx treatment exerted a greater effect on male mice than female mice. Western blotting and immunofluorescence revealed that male mice treated with MPTP had higher expression of α-synuclein and proteins related to neuroinflammation and intestinal inflammation based on activation of glial cells and the TLR4-MyD88 signalling pathway. The sex-specific differences could be due to the different composition of the intestinal microbiota. Specifically, female mice had significantly higher abundance of Allobaculum, Turicibacter and Ruminococcus than male mice. Moreover, the abundance of the probiotic genus Bifidobacterium showed opposite trends in male and female mice. Our results indicate that the intestinal microbiota has an important effect on PD mice, especially male mice, by influencing neuroinflammation through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In the future, there should be a focus on providing more reliable evidence for the pathogenesis and precise treatment of PD.",2023,12,27
Molecular organization of neuronal cell types and neuromodulatory systems in the zebrafish telencephalon.,"The function of neuronal networks is determined not only by synaptic connectivity but also by neuromodulatory systems that broadcast information via distributed connections and volume transmission. To understand the molecular constraints that organize neuromodulatory signaling in the telencephalon of adult zebrafish, we used transcriptomics and additional approaches to delineate cell types, to determine their phylogenetic conservation, and to map the expression of marker genes at high granularity. The combinatorial expression of GPCRs and cell-type markers indicates that all neuronal cell types are subject to modulation by multiple monoaminergic systems and distinct combinations of neuropeptides. Individual cell types were associated with multiple (typically >30) neuromodulatory signaling networks but expressed only a few diagnostic GPCRs at high levels, suggesting that different neuromodulatory systems act in combination, albeit with unequal weights. These results provide a detailed map of cell types and brain areas in the zebrafish telencephalon, identify core components of neuromodulatory networks, highlight the cell-type specificity of neuropeptides and GPCRs, and begin to decipher the logic of combinatorial neuromodulation.",2023,12,23
Antibody targeting of conserved sites of vulnerability on the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain.,"Given the continuous emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VoCs), immunotherapeutics that target conserved epitopes on the spike (S) glycoprotein have therapeutic advantages. Here, we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding domain (RBD) at 1.95 Å and describe flexibility and distinct conformations of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding site. We identify a set of SARS-CoV-2-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with broad RBD cross-reactivity including SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants, SARS-CoV-1, and other sarbecoviruses and determine the crystal structures of mAb-RBD complexes with Ab246 and CR3022 mAbs targeting the class IV site, WRAIR-2134, which binds the recently designated class V epitope, and WRAIR-2123, the class I ACE2-binding site. The broad reactivity of class IV and V mAbs to conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 VoCs and other sarbecovirus provides a framework for long-term immunotherapeutic development strategies.",2023,12,16
All-Purpose Measure of Electron Correlation for Multireference Diagnostics.,"We present an analytical relationship between two natural orbital occupancy-based indices, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mover><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></msub><mspace></mspace></mrow><mrow><mo>¯</mo></mrow></mover></math> and <i>I</i><sub>ND</sub><sup>max</sup>, and two established electron correlation metrics: the leading term of a configuration interaction expansion, <i>c</i><sub>0</sub>, and the <i>D</i><sub>2</sub> diagnostic. Numerical validation revealed that <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mover><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mrow><mi>N</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow></msub><mspace></mspace></mrow><mrow><mo>¯</mo></mrow></mover></math> and <i>I</i><sub>ND</sub><sup>max</sup> can effectively substitute for <i>c</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>D</i><sub>2</sub>, respectively. These indices offer three distinct advantages: (i) they are universally applicable across all electronic structure methods, (ii) their interpretation is more intuitive, and (iii) they can be readily incorporated into the development of hybrid electronic structure methods. Additionally, we draw a distinction between correlation measures and correlation diagnostics, establishing MP2 and CCSD numerical thresholds for <i>I</i><sub>ND</sub><sup>max</sup>, which are to be used as a multireference diagnostic. Our findings further demonstrate that establishing thresholds for other electronic structure methods can be easily accomplished using small data sets.",2023,12,29
Peculiar Differences between Two Copper Complexes Containing Similar Redox-Active Ligands: Density Functional and Multiconfigurational Calculations.,"Transition metal complexes featuring redox-active ligands often exhibit multiple redox states, influenced by the interplay between the metal center and the ligand. This study delves into the electronic structures of two mononuclear complexes of copper with two similar redox-active urea azine ligands. The ligands differ by the replacement of an NCH<sub>3</sub> moiety by an S atom in the ligand backbone. Experimental analysis yields pronounced electronic structural disparities between these complexes, observable in both the solution and solid phases. Conventional quantum chemical methods, such as density functional theory using different functionals (B3LYP, TPSSh, and CAM-B3LYP), remain inadequate to rationalize the observed spectroscopic anomalies. However, a multiconfigurational approach elucidates the disparate behaviors of these complexes. Multireference perturbation theory, based on complete active space self-consistent field computations, identifies Cu(I) in the case of the complex with the NCH<sub>3</sub> containing ligands and a state with substantial Cu(II) contributions in the case of the complex with the S atom containing ligands. In contrast, DFT indicates Cu(I) in both scenarios.",2023,12,29
The effects of umbrella handle shape and grip type on muscle activation and postural variability under windy conditions.,"This study investigated how different shapes of umbrella handles and grip types influence muscle activation and postural variability under windy conditions. Seventeen adult participants were enrolled in this study, and different handle shapes (cylindrical, ellipsoidal, and triangular prism-shaped), grip types (four- and five-finger grip), and wind strengths were tested. Activation of the forearm and upper arm muscles was recorded using surface electromyography. Postural variability and ratings of (1) perceived difficulty of use and (2) perceived grip-posture variability were measured. The results indicated that activation of the finger flexor muscle increased under windy conditions, whereas postural variability was not affected. Weak wind (3.2-7.5 m/s) conditions caused greater perceived postural variability and activation of the wrist extensor muscle. The ellipsoidal handle shape had lower endpoint postural variability when held with a five-finger grip and also had lower perceived postural variability and difficulty compared to that with the cylindrical shape. Our findings can be used to select appropriate umbrella handle designs based on grip type and wind conditions.",2023,12,27
Novel ferrofluid based on water-based deep eutectic solvents: application in dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction of naphthalene-derived plant growth regulators in edible oil.,"A new ferrofluid extractant (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> @SiO<sub>2</sub>-WDES) was ingeniously prepared by coating magnetic Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> @SiO<sub>2</sub> microspheres with water-based deep eutectic solvent (WDES) and used for dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) and HPLC determination of naphthalene-derived plant growth regulators (PGRs, i.e., 1-naphthylacetic acid, 2-naphthylacetic acid, 1-naphthoxy acetic acid, 2-naphthyloxyacetic acid and 1-naphthylacetamide) in edible oil. Herein, mass transfer of the analytes in DLLME was significantly enhanced via increasing the contact surface by employing the microspheres as the supporter and dispersant of WDES, and phase separation can be efficiently achieved using an external magnet rather than centrifugation in traditional DLLME. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on Box-Behnken design (BBD) was employed for the optimization of core experimental conditions, and Analytical Eco-Scale and Analytical GREEnness Metric Approaches were adopted to evaluate the degree of greenness of the procedure. Under the optimal conditions, satisfactory performances of linearity ranged from 5 to 100 μg/L (R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.9982), limit of detection (0.58-0.91 μg/L), limit of quantitation (1.9-3.0 μg/L), precision (RSDs ≤ 5.5%), recovery (81.3%-108.1%) and negligible matrix effect were achieved, which introduced a promising alternative route for the determination of naphthalene-derived plant growth regulators in edible oil.",2023,12,14
Nanoplastics exacerbate Parkinson's disease symptoms in C. elegans and human cells.,"The increasing prevalence of nanoplastics in our environment due to the widespread use of plastics poses potential health risks that are not yet fully understood. This study examines the physiological and neurotoxic effects of these minuscule nanoplastic particles on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as well as on human cells. Here, we find that 25 nm polystyrene nanoplastic particles can inhibit animal growth and movement at very low concentrations, with varying effects on their surface groups. Furthermore, these nanoplastic particles not only accumulate in the digestive tract but also penetrate further into extraintestinal tissues. Such nanoplastics significantly compromise the integrity of the intestinal barrier, leading to ""leaky gut"" conditions and cause mitochondrial fragmentation in muscles, which possibly explains the observed movement impairments. A striking discovery was that these nanoplastics exacerbate symptoms similar to those of Parkinson's disease (PD), including dopaminergic neuronal degeneration, locomotor dysfunction, and accumulation of α-Synuclein aggregates. Importantly, our study demonstrates that the detrimental effects of nanoplastics on the aggregation of α-Synuclein extend to both C. elegans and human cell models of PD. In conclusion, our research highlights the potential health hazards linked to the physicochemical properties of nanoplastics, underlining the urgency of understanding their interactions with biological systems. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATION: The escalating prevalence of nanoplastics in the environment due to widespread plastic usage raises potential health risks. Studies conducted on C. elegans indicate that even low concentrations of 25 nm polystyrene nanoplastics can impair growth and movement. These particles accumulate in the digestive system, compromising the intestinal barrier, causing ""leaky gut"", as well as inducing Parkinson's-like symptoms. Importantly, in both C. elegans and human cell models of Parkinson's disease, such nanoplastics penetrate tissues or cells and increase α-Synuclein aggregates. This underscores the urgent need to understand the interactions of nanoplastics with biological systems and highlights potential environmental and health consequences.",2023,12,18
Mediation of the JNC/ILC2 pathway in DBP-exacerbated allergic asthma: A molecular toxicological study on neuroimmune positive feedback mechanism.,"Dibutyl phthalate (DBP), a commonly used plasticizer, has been found to be strongly linked to a consistently high prevalence of allergic diseases, particularly allergic asthma. Previous animal experiments have demonstrated that exposure to DBP can worsen asthma by triggering the production of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide in the lung tissue. However, the precise neuroimmune mechanism and pathophysiology of DBP-exacerbated allergic asthma with the assistance of CGRP remain unclear.",2023,12,23
Investigation of Far-UVC (222 nm) disinfection of bioaerosols deposited on surfaces with different material properties.,"Far-ultraviolet C (UVC) light has demonstrated its ability to inactivate microbes on surfaces. However, the factors influencing the efficacy of far-UVC surface disinfection remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects of material properties on far-UVC disinfection of bioaerosols (represented by Escherichia coli (E. coli)) deposited on surfaces. The susceptibility constants (Z-values) of E. coli on 14 common materials were measured and analyzed. Additionally, five possible influencing factors (roughness, pores, electrostatic charge, wetness, and temperature) related to surface properties were investigated by control experiments. The results show that far-UVC light effectively disinfected E. coli on the 14 materials, with disinfection efficiencies ranging from 69.1% to 98.9% under a dose of 100.8 J/m<sup>2</sup>. Surface roughness and electrostatic charges had negligible influence on far-UVC disinfection of E. coli on surfaces. However, for porous materials, pore sizes larger than the E. coli size resulted in lower Z-values. Higher surface wetness decreased both the Z-value and natural decay rate. Meanwhile, a higher surface temperature of 40 °C resulted in a higher Z-value and natural decay rate. The results can improve our understanding of far-UVC disinfection of microbes on surfaces, and the database can be used for numerical models.",2023,12,23
Europium-doped strontium gadolinium oxide phosphor: Investigating structural and photoluminescence characteristics via sol-gel combustion synthesis.,"SrGd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> phosphors doped with Eu<sup>3+</sup> were successfully synthesized through a sol-gel combustion method, covering a range of dopant concentrations from 0.25 mol% to 3 mol%. The structural analysis of these phosphor materials was comprehensively conducted utilizing various techniques, including X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRD), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In addition to unveiling the structural characteristics, these analyses provide valuable insights into the compositional aspects, enhancing our understanding of the synthesized SrGd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup> phosphors across different doping levels. XRD analysis findings validate the successful generation of the intended SrGd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> host, demonstrating orthorhombic system structures consistent with JPCD card number 98-019-3592. FTIR analyses conducted on the phosphor samples not only identify bending modes but also reveal intricate details about small vibration bonds within the material. When excited by the 349 nm laser, SrGd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:xEu<sup>3+</sup> phosphors exhibit distinct photoluminescence (PL) properties like red emission at 614 nm from Eu<sup>3+</sup>. From the emission spectra, one can clearly observe that Eu<sup>3+</sup> with an ionic radius close to the Gd<sup>3+</sup> ion preferentially occupies the symmetry sites of the host lattice. The optimal doping concentration was determined to be 0.5 mol%, as revealed by the data in our study. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the luminescence quenching mechanism was attained, pinpointing the involvement of dipole-dipole (d-d) energy transfer in this intriguing phenomenon. This optimal concentration not only enhances the material's properties but also underscores the pivotal role of d-d interactions in governing the luminescence behavior within the doped system.",2023,12,27
A comparative study of a traditional localization algorithm and a deep learning model for radioactive particle tracking application.,"Radioactive particle tracking is a nuclear technique that tracks a sealed radioactive particle inside a volume through a mathematical location algorithm, which is widely applied in many fields such as chemical and civil engineering in hydrodynamics flows. It is possible to reconstruct the trajectory of the radioactive particle using a traditional mathematical algorithm or artificial intelligence methods. In this paper, the traditional algorithm is based on solving a minimization problem between the simulated events and a calibration dataset, and it was written using C++ language. The artificial intelligence method is represented by a deep neural network, in which hyperparameters were defined using a Python optimization library called Optuna. This paper aims to compare the potentiality of both methods to evaluate the accuracy of the radioactive particle tracking technique. This study proposes a simplified model of a concrete mixer, six NaI(Tl) detectors, and a<sup>137</sup>Cs sealed radioactive particle. The simulated measurement geometry and the dataset (3615 patterns) were developed using the MCNPX code, which is a mathematical code based on the Monte Carlo Method. The results show a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 20.81%, 10.33%, and 16.84% for x, y and z coordinates, respectively, for the traditional algorithm. For the deep neural network, MAPE is 6.87%, 2.70%, and 22.79% respectively for x, y and z coordinates. In addition, an investigation is carried out to analyze whether the size of the calibration dataset influences the performance of both methods.",2023,12,23
"Chitosan oligosaccharide improves intestinal function by promoting intestinal development, alleviating intestinal inflammatory response, and enhancing antioxidant capacity in broilers aged d 1 to 14.","This study was conducted to investigate the effects of chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) supplementation on intestinal development and functions, inflammatory response, antioxidant capacity and the related signaling pathways in broilers aged d 1 to 14. A total of 240 one-day old male Arbor Acres broilers (40.47 ± 0.30 g) were randomly allotted to 4 groups, and each group consisted of 6 replicate pens with 10 broilers per replicate. Broilers fed a basal diet supplementation with COS at 0 (CON group), 200 (COS<sub>200</sub> group), 400 (COS<sub>400</sub> group), and 800 mg/kg (COS<sub>800</sub> group) for 14 d, respectively. Broilers in the COS supplementation groups had no significant effects on growth performance. Compared to the CON group, dietary COS supplementation increased (P < 0.05) the relative weight of duodenum, jejunal lipase activity, duodenal and ileal villus surface area, and lower (P < 0.05) ileal amylase and alkaline phosphatase activity, and crypt depth. The expression level of duodenal glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1), peptide transporter 1 (PepT1), occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and interleukin-10 (IL-10), jejunal SGLT1, PepT1, occludin, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and ileal SGLT1, PepT1, and fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1) was upregulated by COS. However, the expression level of duodenal FABP1 and TNF-α, jejunal GLUT1, ZO-1, TLR4, MyD88, nuclear factor kappa-B p65 (NF-κB p65), and IL-1β, and ileal GLUT1, NF-κB p65, and IL-1β was downregulated by COS. Furthermore, dietary COS supplementation increased duodenal catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity, jejunal CAT and T-SOD activity, upregulated the expression level of duodenal nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), CAT, glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), and copper and zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD), jejunal CAT, and ileal Nrf2, CAT, and GPX1. These results suggested that COS could promote intestinal development and functions in broilers aged d 1 to 14, which might be mediated by alleviating intestinal inflammatory response and enhancing antioxidant capacity.",2023,12,15
Zero-shot information extraction from radiological reports using ChatGPT.,"Electronic health records contain an enormous amount of valuable information recorded in free text.

"Family 3 CBM improves the biochemical properties, substrate hydrolysis and coconut oil extraction by hemicellulolytic and holocellulolytic chimeras.","To understand the influence of family 3 Carbohydrate Binding Module (hereafter CBM3), single (GH5 cellulase; CelB, CelBΔCBM), bi-chimeric [GH26 endo-mannanase (ManB-1601) and GH11 endo-xylanase (XynB); ManB-XynB [1], ManB-XynB-CBM] and tri-chimeric [ManB-XynB-CelB [1], ManB-XynB-CelBΔCBM] enzyme variants (fused or deleted of CBM) were produced and purified to homogeneity. CBM3 did not alter the pH and temperature optima of bi- and tri-chimeric enzymes but improved the pH and temperature stability of ManB in CBM variants of bi-/tri-chimeric enzymes. Truncation of CBM in CelB shifted the pH optimum and increased the melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub> 65 ℃). CBM3 improved both substrate affinity (K<sub>m</sub>) and catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) of fused enzymes in tri-chimera and CelB but only K<sub>m</sub> for bi-chimera. Far-UV CD of CelB and bi- and tri-chimeric enzymes suggested that CBM3 improved the α-helical content and compactness in the native state but did not prevent disintegration of secondary structural contents at acidic pH. Steady-state fluorescence studies suggested that under acidic conditions CBM3 prevented the exposure of hydrophobic patches in bi-chimeric protein but could not avert the opening up of chimeric enzyme structure. Aqueous enzyme assisted treatment of mature coconut kernel using single, bi- and tri-chimeric enzymes led to cracks, peeling and fracturing of the matrix and improved the oil yield by up to 22%.",2023,12,12
RVvictor: Virus RNA-directed molecular interactions for RNA virus infection.,"RNA viruses are major human pathogens that cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemic outbreaks. Due to the nature of their RNA genomes, it is anticipated that virus's RNA interacts with host protein (INTPRO), messenger RNA (INTmRNA), and non-coding RNA (INTncRNA) to perform their particular functions during their transcription and replication. In other words, thus, it is urgently needed to have such valuable data on virus RNA-directed molecular interactions (especially INTPROs), which are highly anticipated to attract broad research interests in the fields of RNA virus translation and replication. In this study, a new database was constructed to describe the virus RNA-directed interaction (INTPRO, INTmRNA, INTncRNA) for RNA virus (RVvictor). This database is unique in a) unambiguously characterizing the interactions between viruses RNAs and host proteins, b) providing, for the first time, the most systematic RNA-directed interaction data resources in providing clues to understand the molecular mechanisms of RNA viruses' translation, and replication, and c) in RVvictor, comprehensive enrichment analysis is conducted for each virus RNA based on its associated target genes/proteins, and the enrichment results were explicitly illustrated using various graphs. We found significant enrichment of a suite of pathways related to infection, translation, and replication, e.g., HIV infection, coronavirus disease, regulation of viral genome replication, and so on. Due to the devastating and persistent threat posed by the RNA virus, RVvictor constructed, for the first time, a possible network of cross-talk in RNA-directed interaction, which may ultimately explain the pathogenicity of RNA virus infection. The knowledge base might help develop new anti-viral therapeutic targets in the future. It's now free and publicly accessible at: https://idrblab.org/rvvictor/.",2023,12,20
Identification of key genes associated with persistent immune changes and secondary immune activation responses induced by influenza vaccination after COVID-19 recovery by machine learning methods.,"COVID-19 is hypothesized to exert enduring effects on the immune systems of patients, leading to alterations in immune-related gene expression. This study aimed to scrutinize the persistent implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on gene expression and its influence on subsequent immune activation responses. We designed a machine learning-based approach to analyze transcriptomic data from both healthy individuals and patients who had recovered from COVID-19. Patients were categorized based on their influenza vaccination status and then compared with healthy controls. The initial sample set encompassed 86 blood samples from healthy controls and 72 blood samples from recuperated COVID-19 patients prior to influenza vaccination. The second sample set included 123 blood samples from healthy controls and 106 blood samples from recovered COVID-19 patients who had been vaccinated against influenza. For each sample, the dataset captured expression levels of 17,060 genes. Above two sample sets were first analyzed by seven feature ranking algorithms, yielding seven feature lists for each dataset. Then, each list was fed into the incremental feature selection method, incorporating three classic classification algorithms, to extract essential genes, classification rules and build efficient classifiers. The genes and rules were analyzed in this study. The main findings included that NEXN and ZNF354A were highly expressed in recovered COVID-19 patients, whereas MKI67 and GZMB were highly expressed in patients with secondary immune activation post-COVID-19 recovery. These pivotal genes could provide valuable insights for future health monitoring of COVID-19 patients and guide the creation of continued treatment regimens.",2023,12,22
Learning with limited annotations: A survey on deep semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation.,"Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and critical step in many image-guided clinical approaches. Recent success of deep learning-based segmentation methods usually relies on a large amount of labeled data, which is particularly difficult and costly to obtain, especially in the medical imaging domain where only experts can provide reliable and accurate annotations. Semi-supervised learning has emerged as an appealing strategy and been widely applied to medical image segmentation tasks to train deep models with limited annotations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of recently proposed semi-supervised learning methods for medical image segmentation and summarize both the technical novelties and empirical results. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss the limitations and several unsolved problems of existing approaches. We hope this review can inspire the research community to explore solutions to this challenge and further advance the field of medical image segmentation.",2023,12,16
A dual process model of spontaneous conscious thought.,"In the present article, I review theory and evidence on the psychological mechanisms of mind wandering, paying special attention to its relation with executive control. I then suggest applying a dual-process framework (i.e., automatic vs. controlled processing) to mind wandering and goal-directed thought. I present theoretical arguments and empirical evidence in favor of the view that mind wandering is based on automatic processing, also considering its relation to the concept of working memory. After that, I outline three scenarios for an interplay between mind wandering and goal-directed thought during task performance (parallel automatic processing, off-task thought substituting on-task thought, and non-disruptive mind wandering during controlled processing) and address the ways in which the mind-wandering and focused-attention spells can terminate. Throughout the article, I formulate empirical predictions. In conclusion, I discuss how automatic and controlled processing may be balanced in human conscious cognition.",2023,12,28
"Application of films developed with tilapia gelatin (Oreochromis niloticus), added with pitomba plant extract (Talisia esculenta) in Hawaii papaya.","In the present study, a film based on the gelatin skin of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was developed, using surfactants and adding plant extract of pitomba seed (Talisia esculenta). The aim was to investigate the mechanical and barrier properties of the cover, as well as its effectiveness in conserving papayas against diseases caused by fungi. The film presented tensile strength of 38.78 MPa, elongation of 120.49%, and water vapor permeability of 5.90 g.mm.h<sup>-1</sup>.m<sup>2</sup>.kPa<sup>-1</sup> when equally composed of SDS and Tween 80, in a percentage of 40% in relation to the total mass of the film. The films lasted 12 d in an environment with a relative humidity of 75% (25 ºC), longer than the shelf life of papaya (limited to 8 d).

Expression and functional characterization of bovine receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL).,"Receptor activator of nuclear factor Kappa-B Ligand (RANKL) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor ligand (TNF) family involved in immune responses and immunomodulation. Expressed in various cells types around the body, RANKL plays a crucial role in bone remodeling and development of the thymus, lymph nodes and mammary glands. Research in other species demonstrates that RANKL is required for the development of microfold cells (M cells) in the gut, however limited information specific to cattle is available. Cloning and expression of bovine RANKL (BoRANKL) was carried out and bioactivity of the protein was demonstrated in the induction of osteoclast differentiation from both bovine and ovine bone marrow cells. The effects of BoRANKL on particle uptake in bovine enteroids was also assessed. The production of cross-reactive bovine RANKL protein will enable further investigations into cell differentiation using the available ruminant organoid systems, and their role in investigating host-pathogen interactions in cattle and sheep.",2023,12,21
Early versus delayed weight bearing after internal fixation for femoral neck fracture in younger adults: A multicenter retrospective study.,"Femoral neck fracture (FNF) is among the most common and devastating injuries that orthopedic surgeons encounter. However, the incidence of FNF is lower in younger adults than in elderly individuals. In elderly FNF patients, early weight bearing (EWB) is preferred to prevent loss of function and decreased activity. In younger adults, some surgeons decide on delayed-weight bearing (DWB) after surgery because EWB may cause femoral neck shortening. We aimed to compare the postoperative results (clinical outcome, radiological evaluation, and complications) of EWB and DWB after FNF surgery in younger adults.",2023,12,17
[Communication with a culturally and linguistically diverse population from Primary Care].,"The care of a culturally and linguistically diverse population is a challenge in primary health care due to language barriers and cultural differences. For this reason, good communication and cultural competence of health personnel is key within medical consultation. Thus, during consultations with this group of people, it is the doctor's duty to identify the patient's culture, their perception of the concept of health, in what way and to what extent they want to be informed, and the role they want to assign to the members of their family before the treatment process begins. For this reason, there are interventions that seek to optimize the care provided to these patients and mitigate the cultural barrier, including the use of multimodal digital tools, the use of translators or interpreters, and training of health personnel in communication and intercultural skills.",2023,12,28

Fabrication and evaluation of a molecular-imprinted-polymer functionalized electrode for selective electric field-assisted solid-phase microextraction of phytohormones.,"Specific extraction and separation plays a pivotal role in the accurate quantification of trace phytohormones (PHs). However, due to their high polarity, specific capture of PHs is challenging. In this study, under the assistance of electric field, a molecular-imprinted-polymer functionalized electrode (MIP@ED) was in-situ prepared using 3-indoleacetic acid (IAA) as template and employed as the adsorbent of electric field-assisted solid-phase microextraction (EA-SPME) for specific capture of PHs. Results showed that the implementation of electric field during the preparation of MIP@ED and EA-SPME procedures improved the extraction selectivity, the selective factors towards IAA and its structural analogues increased from 2.09 to 2.45 to 2.88-3.51. Under the optimum conditions, the proposed MIP@ED/EA-SPME was combined with HPLC technique to monitor trace PHs in water and agricultural products. The achieved limits of detection were in the ranges of 0.0053-0.011 μg/L and 0.048-0.12 μg/kg for water and agricultural product, respectively. The established approach was successfully applied to quantify trace PHs in real samples, and the spiked recoveries varied from 84.0 % to 118 % with good repeatability (RSDs blow 10 %). The obtained results provided clear evidence that the developed approach employing the MIP@ED/EA-SPME technique demonstrated high sensitivity, good selectivity, satisfactory reproducibility and environmental friendliness in the quantification of trace PHs in complex samples.

Hierarchical attention-guided multiscale aggregation network for infrared small target detection.,"All man-made flying objects in the sky, ships in the ocean can be regarded as small infrared targets, and the method of tracking them has been received widespread attention in recent years. In search of a further efficient method for infrared small target recognition, we propose a hierarchical attention-guided multiscale aggregation network (HAMANet) in this thesis. The proposed HAMANet mainly consists of a compound guide multilayer perceptron (CG-MLP) block embedded in the backbone net, a spatial-interactive attention module (SiAM), a pixel-interactive attention module (PiAM) and a contextual fusion module (CFM). The CG-MLP marked the width-axis, height-axis, and channel-axis, which can result in a better segmentation effect while reducing computational complexity. SiAM improves global semantic information exchange by increasing the connections between different channels, while PiAM changes the extraction of local key information features by enhancing information exchange at the pixel level. CFM fuses low-level positional information and high-level channel information of the target through coding to improve network stability and target feature utilization. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods on public infrared small target datasets, the results show that our proposed HAMANet has high detection accuracy and a low false-alarm rate.",2023,12,22
Ceria nanoclusters coupled with Ce-Nx sites for efficient oxygen reduction in Zn-air batteries.,"Rational construction of efficient carbon-supported rare earth cerium nanoclusters as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great significance to promote the practical application of zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, N doped conductive carbon black anchored CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoclusters (CeO<sub>2</sub> Clusters/NC) for the ORR is reported. The volatile cerium species vaporized by CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoclusters at high temperatures are captured by nitrogen-rich carbon carriers to form highly dispersed Ce-Nx active sites. Benefiting from the coupling effect between oxygen vacancies-enriched CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoclusters and highly dispersed Ce-Nx sites, the prepared 2CeO<sub>2</sub> Clusters/NC catalyst possesses an ORR half-wave potential of 0.88 V, superior electrochemical stability, and better methanol tolerance compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, the 2CeO<sub>2</sub> Clusters/NC involved liquid ZABs show excellent energy efficiency, superior stability, and a high energy density of 982 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>.",2023,12,22
Difunctional Ag nanoparticles with high lithiophilic and conductive decorate on core-shell SiO<sub>2</sub> nanospheres for dendrite-free lithium metal anodes.,"Lithium metal is an attractive and promising anode material due to its high energy density and low working potential. However, the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites during repeated plating and stripping processes hinders the practical application of lithium metal batteries, leading to low Coulombic efficiency, poor lifespan, and safety concerns. In this study, we synthesized highly lithiophilic and conductive Ag nanoparticles decorated on SiO<sub>2</sub> nanospheres to construct an optimized lithium host for promoting uniform Li deposition. The Ag nanoparticles not only act as lithiophilic sites but also provide high electrical conductivity to the Ag@SiO<sub>2</sub>@Ag anode. Additionally, the SiO<sub>2</sub> layer serves as a lithiophilic nucleation agent, ensuring homogeneous lithium deposition and suppressing the growth of lithium dendrites. Theoretical calculations further confirm that the combination of Ag nanoparticles and SiO<sub>2</sub> effectively enhances the adsorption ability of Ag@SiO<sub>2</sub>@Ag with Li<sup>+</sup> ions compared to pure Ag and SiO<sub>2</sub> materials. As a result, the Ag@SiO<sub>2</sub>@Ag coating, with its balanced lithiophilicity and conductivity, demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance, including high Coulombic efficiency, low polarization voltage, and long cycle life. In a full lithium metal cell with LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cathode, the Ag@SiO<sub>2</sub>@Ag anode exhibits a high capacity of 133.1 and 121.4 mAh/g after 200 cycles at rates of 0.5 and 1C, respectively. These results highlight the synergistic coupling of lithiophilicity and conductivity in the Ag@SiO<sub>2</sub>@Ag coating, providing valuable insights into the field of lithiophilic chemistry and its potential for achieving high-performance batteries in the next generation.",2023,12,23
Optimal risk and diagnosis assessment strategies in perinatal depression: A machine learning approach from the life-ON study cohort.,"This study aimed to assess the concordance of various psychometric scales in detecting Perinatal Depression (PND) risk and diagnosis. A cohort of 432 women was assessed at 10-15th and 23-25th gestational weeks, 33-40 days and 180-195 days after delivery using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess agreement across instruments, and multivariable classification models were developed to predict the values of a binary scale using the other scales. Moderate agreement was shown between the EPDS and VAS and between the HDRS and MADRS throughout the perinatal period. However, agreement between the EPDS and HDRS decreased postpartum. A well-performing model for the estimation of current depression risk (EPDS > 9) was obtained with the VAS and MADRS, and a less robust one for the estimation of current major depressive episode (MDE) diagnosis (MINI) with the VAS and HDRS. When the EPDS is not feasible, the VAS may be used for rapid and comprehensive postpartum screening with reliability. However, a thorough structured interview or clinical examination remains necessary to diagnose a MDE.",2023,12,24

"Nearest-neighbour parametrization of DNA single, double and triple mismatches at low sodium concentration.","DNA mismatches, that is, base pairs different from the canonical AT and CG, are involved in numerous biological processes and can be a problem for technological applications such as PCR amplification. The nearest-neighbour (NN) model is the standard approach for predicting melting temperatures and is used in methods of secondary structure predictions and modelling of hybridization kinetics. However, despite its biological and technological importance, existing NN parameters that include DNA mismatches are incomplete, and those available were obtained from a limited set of melting temperature at high sodium concentration. To our knowledge, there is currently no NN set of parameters for up to three mismatches covering all configurations at low sodium concentrations. Here, we are applying the NN model to a large set of 4096 published melting temperatures, covering all combinations of single, double and triple mismatches. Dealing with such a large set of temperature is challenging in several ways, bringing new methodological problems. Here, optimizing a large number of 252 independent parameters has required the development of a new method where we readjust the seed parameters using the definition of the Gibbs free energy. The new parameters predict the training set within 1.1 °C and the validation set to 2.7 °C.",2023,12,22
"Immune-mediated diseases after vaccinations with AZD1222, BNT-162b2, &/or mRNA-1273: An observational investigation of 78 patients.","Immune-mediated diseases (IMDs) after nucleic acid-based vaccines have been sporadically reported since their introduction during the worldwide COVID-19 crisis. Confirming their cause-effect association remains challenging. We analysed the effects of AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), BNT-162b2, and/or mRNA-1273 on the development &/or deterioration of IMDs in terms of the time of clinical onsets of IMDs after exposure to these vaccines.",2023,12,28
A novel pterostilbene compound DCZ0825 induces macrophage M1 differentiation and Th1 polarization to exert anti-myeloma and immunomodulatory.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable and recurrent malignancy characterized by abnormal plasma cell proliferation. There is an urgent need to develop effective drugs in MM. DCZ0825 is a small molecule compound derived from pterostilbene with direct anti-myeloma activity and indirect immune-killing effects though reversal of the immunosuppression. DCZ0825 inhibits the activity and proliferation of MM cells causing no significant toxicity to normal cells. Using flow cytometry, this study found that DCZ0825 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in MM cells and arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase by down-regulating CyclinB1, CDK1 and CDC25. Moreover, DCZ0825 up-regulated IRF3 and IRF7 to increase IFN-γ, promoting M2 macrophages to transform into M1 macrophages, releasing the immunosuppression of CD4T cells and stimulated M1 macrophages and Th1 cells to secrete more INF-γ to form immune killing effect on MM cells. Treatment with DCZ0825 resulted in an increased proportion of positive regulatory cells such as CD4T, memory T cells, CD8T, and NK cells, with downregulation of the proportion of negative regulatory cells such as Treg cells and MDSCs. In conclusion, DCZ0825 is a novel compound with both antitumor and immunomodulatory activity.",2023,12,28
Age at first birth is associated with the likelihood of frailty in middle-aged and older women: A population-based analysis from NHANES 1999-2018.,This study examined whether age at first birth (AFB) is associated with the prevalence of frailty in middle-aged and older women.,2023,12,25
Efficient extraction of adventitious virus nucleic acid using commercially available methods.,"An essential step in pharmaceutical product development is screening for contamination with adventitious agents, and there is desire to develop highly sensitive assays to detect adventitious viral nucleic acid. This study sought to examine the nucleic acid extraction efficiency of three viral candidates in relevant background matrices using four different extraction methods. Three model adventitious viruses, Minute virus of Mice, Porcine Circovirus, and Feline Leukemia Virus, were diluted within a variety of background matrices relevant to pharmaceutical production methods. Upon extraction, the nucleic acid was quantified using droplet digital PCR methods. Four nucleic acid extraction methods were assessed, including commercially available kits and manual extraction methods. Each method recovered nucleic acid post-extraction for each of the model viruses within the tested background matrices. The silica-column based method recovered a greater amount of viral nucleic acid, compared to the other methods tested. Similar trends were observed when model virus was diluted in bioreactor supernatant, which replicates industry testing conditions and provides details on which extraction methods might be used in Next Generation Sequencing and PCR methods for detecting contamination within pharmaceutical products.",2023,12,28
Vehicular homicide or cardiovascular event? The importance of the autopsy findings.,"We present the case of a 61 years old woman who was hit by a car, resulting in fractures of the pubic bone, left ischium-pubis ramus and right femur, with need of hip replacement surgery. In the next days she was affected by two episodes of acute coronary syndrome, treated with coronary angioplasty surgery. After undergoing total hip replacement surgery an episode of asystole caused her death. A full autopsy showed coronary stenosis and chronic ischemic heart disease associated with a recent myocardial infarction. The pre-existing condition of T.L. could not be ignored but the initial traumatic event and the subsequent fractures played a further co-occurrent causal role. The initial trauma represented the first step of the phenomenological chain that led to a series of adverse cardiological events and to an irreversible asystole, so that the car driver should be partly considered accountable for the death of the woman.",2023,12,26
Micro-CT evaluation of morphological degenerative features of sterno-clavicular joint for age-at-death estimation in forensic anthropology - A qualitative analysis.,"The analysis of the sternoclavicular joint holds significant importance in forensic anthropology, especially through the evaluation of medial clavicular ossification stage, which, however, is helpful only in subjects younger than 30 years of age. Given this limitation, the aim of the present work was to examine, through micro-CT, the surface of sternoclavicular joints of deceased individuals across various age groups, aiming to identify age-related degenerative changes applicable to age estimation in adults over 30 years old. A total of 41 deceased subjects were categorized into three age groups (20-39 years; 40-59 years; ≥60 years) for the analysis. Degenerative morphological features on both clavicular and sternal articular surfaces, including topography, porosity, and presence of osteophytes, were evaluated using a composite scoring system based on a modified ""Falys-Prangle method."", which assigns to each parameter specific score ranges: 1-3 for surface topography (smooth, slightly irregular, markedly irregular), 1-6 for porosity (absent, micro- and macroporosity for <50 % or >50 % of surface, surface breakdown), 1-3 for osteophytes (absent, present, not evaluable). The findings revealed a positive correlation between degenerative morphological features and age for both clavicular (rs = 0.719) and sternal articular surfaces (rs = 0.750). Additionally, the combined assessment of the clavicle and sternum, or the evaluation of the clavicle alone, exhibited better differentiation among the three age groups. The micro-CT evaluation of degenerative alterations affecting the sternoclavicular joint proves to be a reliable and efficient method for age estimation in adults.",2023,12,21
Is Bohr's correspondence principle just Hankel's principle of permanence?,"No, but the paper argues that Bohr understood his correspondence principle, or at least an aspect of that principle expressed by the notion of rational generalization, as grounded in Hankel's principle of permanence, adapted to new historical and theoretical contexts. This is shown to illuminate some otherwise obscure aspects of Bohr's approach to quantum theory, as well as a seemingly strange criticism against this approach, due to Feyerabend and Bohm.",2023,12,28
Behavioral stress and antidepressant treatments altered hippocampal expression of Nogo signal-related proteins in rats.,"Some immune molecules including neurite outgrowth inhibitor (Nogo) ligands and their receptor（Nogo receptor-1: NgR1）are expressed at the neuronal synaptic sites. Paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB) is another Nogo receptor that also binds to major histocompatibility complex I and β-amyloid and suppresses dendritic immune cell functions and neuronal plasticity in the central nervous system. Augmenting structural and functional neural plasticity by manipulating the Nogo signaling pathway is a novel promising strategy for treating brain ischemia and degenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease. In recent decades psychiatric research using experimental animals has focused on the attenuation of neural plasticity by stress loadings and on the enhanced resilience by psychopharmacological treatments. In the present study, we examined possible expressional alterations in Nogo signal-related proteins in the rat hippocampus after behavioral stress loadings and antidepressant treatments. To validate the effectiveness of the procedures, previously reported increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by ECS or ketamine administration and decrease of BDNF by stress loadings are also shown in the present study. Significant increases in hippocampal NgR1 and PirB expression were observed following chronic variable stress, and a significant increase in NgR1 expression was observed under a single prolonged stress paradigm. These results indicate a possible contribution of enhanced Nogo signaling to the attenuation of neural plasticity in response to stressful experiences. Additionally, the suppression of hippocampal NgR1 expression using electroconvulsive seizure treatment and administration of subanesthetic dose of ketamine supported the increased neural plasticity induced by the antidepressant treatments.",2023,12,22
Targeting AR-positive breast cancer cells via drug repurposing approach.,"Androgen Receptor (AR) is overexpressed in almost all the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Besides aiding the tumorigenic environment of cancer by abnormal cell proliferation, AR also takes part in promoting cancer signaling pathways, thereby promoting aggressiveness. In this study, AR was selected as the target protein in breast cancer cells. Following this, a library of 1293 FDA-approved drugs was screened via molecular docking, MD simulation, and MMPBSA binding energy. Amongst the library of compounds, Adapalene exhibited the least binding energy of (-10.2 kCal/mol) in comparison to that of the chosen reference compound, Nilutamide (-8.6 kCal/mol). Furthermore, the in vitro efficacy of Adapalene was also determined in two different breast cancer cell lines such as MCF7 (AR-positive/ER-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (AR negative/TNBC). Initially, the cell viability assay (MTT) was performed, which endowed us with a lesser IC<sub>50</sub> value of Adapalene in comparison to Nilutamide in both cell lines. The IC<sub>50</sub> of Adapalene was found to be 12 μM and 39.4 μM in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. Furthermore, Adapalene also induced cellular ROS and apoptosis by 3.5-fold and 26.58% in MCF7 cells. However, the overall effect of Adapalene was significantly lower in the case of MDA-MB-231 cell lines, which could be attributed to its inherent nature of the absence of hormone receptors. Conclusively, Adapalene possesses greater therapeutic efficacy in comparison to the control drug, thereby hinting towards the potential use of Adapalene in the treatment of AR-positive breast cancer.",2023,12,15
Evaluation of the psychometric indicators of the Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory in Iranian adults.,"The DSM-5's Comprehensive Autism Traits Inventory (CATI) was a useful diagnostic tool for the general population because it covered all the critical aspects of autism.

Preparation and fire resistance modification on tannin-based non-isocyanate polyurethane (NIPU) rigid foams.,"Non-isocyanate polyurethane (NIPU) as a new type of polyurethane material has become a hot research topic in the polyurethane industry due to its no utilization of toxic isocyanates during the synthesis process. And the developing on recyclable biomass materials has also much attention in the industrial sector, hence the preparation and application of bio-based NIPU has also become a very meaningful study work. So, in this paper, tannin as a biomass material was used to synthesize tannin based non-isocyanate polyurethanes (TNIPU) resin, and then successfully prepared a self-blowing TNIPU foam at room temperature by using formic acid as initiator and glutaraldehyde as cross-linking agent. The compressive strength of this foam as high as 0.8 MPa, which is an excellent compressive performance. Meanwhile it will return to the state before compression when removing the pressure. This indicating that the foam has good toughness. In addition, formic acid can react with the amino groups in TNIPU to form amide substances, and generated enough heat to initiate the foaming process. Glutaraldehyde, as a crosslinking agent, reacts with the amino group in TNIPU to form a network structure system. By scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation of the cell shapes, it can be seen that the foam cells were uniform in size and shape, and the cell pores showed open and closed cells. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) tested value of this TNIPU foam is 24.45 % without any flame retardant added, but compared to the LOI value of polyurethane foam (17 %-19 %), TNIPU foam reveal a better fire resistance. It has a wider application prospect.",2023,12,28
In vitro characterization of alternative l-threonate and d-erythronate catabolic pathways.,"l-threonate is the metabolite of vitamin C, while d-erythronate is the metabolite of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, the nutritional supplement for joint health. They are widely distributed in the environment and human biofluids. Nevertheless, the catabolisms of l-threonate and d-erythronate are sparsely reported. Here we explored the functional diversity of an acid sugar kinase family (Pfam families PF07005-PF17042), and discovered a novel 2-oxo-tetronate kinase. The conserved genome neighborhood of the 2-oxo-tetronate kinase encodes members of class-II fructose-bisphosphate aldolase family (F_bP_aldolase, PF01116) and a dehydrogenase family (PF03446-PF14833). Instructed by this analysis, we experimentally verified that these enzymes are capable of degrading l-threonate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) in Arthrobacter sp. ZBG10, Clostridium scindens ATCC 35704, and Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans ATCC 55486. Meanwhile, a convergent catabolic pathway for d-erythronate was characterized in P. dioxanivorans ATCC 55486. Moreover, the phylogenetic distribution analysis indicates that the biological range of the identified l-threonate and d-erythronate catabolic pathways appears to extend mostly to members of the Actinomycetota, Cyanobacteriota, Bacillota, Pseudomonadota, and Bacteroidota phyla.",2023,12,25
"Reduction of IL-6, IL-8 and β2-ADRENOCEPTOR mRNA levels in circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes after adenotonsillectomy in children with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome.","Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) affects approximately 1-5% of children and is linked to cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurobehavioral complications. Dysregulation of inflammatory process and sympathetic nervous system overstimulation leading to increased catecholamine production may contribute to OSAS pathogenesis. Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils (PMN), key cells in the inflammatory process, express adrenergic receptors, including β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2), which modulate their functions through an autocrine/paracrine loop. In this pilot study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between OSAS severity, ADRB2 expression in PMN and patient's inflammatory profile before and after adenotonsillectomy.",2023,12,19
Evaluating the risk of phthalate and non-phthalate plasticizers in dust samples from 100 Japanese houses.,"Phthalates are widely used as plasticizer and associated with various health issues. Recently, non-phthalate plasticizers are replacing phthalates; however, the exposure to these substances and the risk in Japan is unclear. In this study, we assessed the concentrations of phthalates, non-phthalate plasticizers, and phthalate degradation products in house dust and determined their respective exposure risks via oral and dermal routes. Twelve phthalates, seven non-phthalate plasticizers, and two degradation products were determined in the house dust obtained from 100 Japanese homes. The median concentration of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), accounting for 85 % of the total concentration of phthalates and non-phthalate plasticizers detected in this study, was 2.1 × 10<sup>3</sup> μg/g of dust. Apart from DEHP, diisononyl phthalate (DINP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHT) were the most abundant in the house dust, accounting for 6.2 % (median: 1.7 × 10<sup>2</sup> μg/g of dust) and 6.1 % (median: 1.7 × 10<sup>2</sup> μg/g of dust) of the total concentrations, respectively. DEHP and DEHT concentrations in house dust were higher in apartment and small houses (floor area: ≤30 m<sup>2</sup> or 31-60 m<sup>2</sup> for DEHP and 31-60 m<sup>2</sup> for DEHT) than in detached and large houses (floor area: ≥121 m<sup>2</sup>). Conversely, di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) concentrations were significantly higher in detached and large houses (floor area: ≥121 m<sup>2</sup>) than in apartment and small houses (floor area: ≤30 m<sup>2</sup>). The total hazard quotient (HQ), using the maximum concentration in house dust, revealed that oral and dermal exposure to house dust was 1.3 × 10<sup>-6</sup>-0.11 for adults (all substances) and 1.6 × 10<sup>-5</sup>-2.2 × 10<sup>-2</sup> for preschool children (except for DnBP and DEHP), suggesting no risk. The HQs for DnBP and DEHP exposure via house dust for preschool children using the maximum values were 0.46 and 1.2, and 6.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup> and 0.18 using the median values, indicating that risk of DEHP exposure should be exhaustively determined by considering other exposure routes that were not evaluated in this study, such as diet.",2023,12,22
Development of a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer Quenchbody sensor for the detection of organophosphorus pesticides in water bodies.,"Rapid and precise quantification of organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) in environmental water bodies is crucial for evaluating ecological risks and safeguarding human health. Traditional instrumental methods are complex, time-consuming, and expensive, while enzyme-based biosensors suffer from instability and require a constant supply of substrates. Hence, there is an urgent need for a fast, simple, and sensitive biosensor for OPPs. In this study, we developed a novel non-enzymatic biosensor for the detection of methyl parathion (MP) by employing the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) Q-body strategy. Optimizing the spacer arm and screening fluorescent dyes identified the R6G BRET MP Q-body sensor with the best performance. Key parameters affecting the sensor's detection performance were optimized by using single-factor experiments. Under optimal conditions, the detection exhibited a detection limit of 5.09 ng·mL<sup>-1</sup> and a linear range of 16.21-848.81 ng·mL<sup>-1</sup>. The sensor's accuracy was validated using standard recovery experiments, yielding a recovery rate of 84.47 %-102.08 % with a standard deviation of 1.93 %-9.25 %. The detection results of actual water samples demonstrate that this fast, simple, and highly sensitive BRET Q-body sensor holds great promise for practical water quality monitoring.",2023,12,22
Influence of water color and catchment lake cover on stream macroinvertebrate communities: Ecological insights into browning effects.,"Browning of streams due to increased export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and iron has been observed in vast areas of the northern hemisphere with likely adverse ecological effects. Lake basins in stream catchments can moderate DOC export and influence stream communities, which complicates understanding of the effects of DOC. In this study, we explored the independent and interactive effects of water color (proxy for DOC and iron) and catchment lake cover on benthic macroinvertebrate communities in 94 medium-sized boreal forest streams. We first investigated the role of lake basins and other catchment characteristics in controlling water color. We then studied the effects of water color and catchment lake cover on macroinvertebrate community composition, biodiversity, and functional feeding traits. Water color correlated negatively with catchment lake cover, whereas the correlation with peatland cover and drainage intensity was positive. PERMANOVA and GLS analyses indicated that both color and catchment lake cover had a distinct independent effect on invertebrate community composition and community attributes, without significant interactions. Color had an independent negative effect on EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) taxa richness irrespective of lake cover. Increasing water color had negative effect on relative abundance of grazer, but no significant effect on shredder trait, while lake cover had a negative effect on both of the traits. Lake cover exhibited a negative influence on collector-gatherers, and a positive effect on filter feeders, while the predators were positively affected by both factors. The results highlight that water color influences the community structure of boreal stream ecosystems, and the effects are similar regardless of catchment lake cover. Mitigation measures should be emphasized, aimed at reducing DOC and iron runoff, in land use planning and river basin management.",2023,12,21
"Decoding China's anthropogenic typical pollutant discharge patterns: Long-term dynamics and hotspot transitions driven by population, diet, and sanitation.","Human activities have led to an alarming increase in pollution, resulting in widespread water contamination. A comprehensive understanding of the quantitative relationship between anthropogenic pollutant discharges and the escalating anthropogenic disturbances and environmental efforts is crucial for effective water quality management. Here we establish a Model for Estimating Anthropogenic pollutaNts diScharges (MEANS) and simulate the long-term dynamics of various types of anthropogenic discharges in China based on an unprecedented spatio-temporal dynamic parameter dataset. Our findings reveal that from 1980 to 2020, anthropogenic discharges exhibited an overall trend of initially increasing and subsequently decreasing, with the peak occurring around 2005. During this period, the dominant pollution sources in China shifted from urban to rural areas, thereby driving the transition of hotspot pollutants from nitrogen to phosphorus in the eastern regions. The most significant drivers of anthropogenic pollutant discharges gradually shifted from population size and dietary structure to wastewater treatment and agricultural factors. Furthermore, we observed that a significant portion of China's regions still exceed the safety thresholds for pollutant discharges, with excessive levels of total phosphorus (TP) being particularly severe. These findings highlight the need for flexible management strategies in the future to address specific pollution levels and hotspots in different regions. Our study underscores the importance of considering the complex interplay between anthropogenic disturbances, environmental efforts, and long-term anthropogenic pollutant discharges for effective water pollution control.",2023,12,21
Continuation of a cleaning process: Application of MNBs-coagulation process to mitigate ultrafiltration membrane fouling.,"The MNBs-coagulation process as a novel and cleaning enhanced coagulation process has been demonstrated to enhance the removal efficiency of hydrophilic organics. In this study, while continuing the concept of cleaning production, the MNBs-coagulation process was first applied to the ultrafiltration process and was expected to alleviate the ultrafiltration membrane fouling. This study investigated the effect of the involvement of MNBs in coagulation-ultrafiltration process (the MC-UF process) on the fouling behaviour of ultrafiltration membrane based on the calculation of membrane resistance distribution and the fitting of membrane fouling model. In addition, the NOM removal efficiency, floc characteristics analysis and membrane hydrophilicity analysis were used to illustrate the mechanism of mitigating ultrafiltration mebrane fouling by the MC-UF process. The experimental results showed that the involvement of MNBs in the coagulation-ultrafiltration process was able to reduce the irreversible fouling and TMP by 43.1 % and 41.6 % respectively. This phenomenon could be attributed to the involvement of MNBs in the coagulation process to improve the removal efficiency of hydrophilic organics and to enhance the characteristics of flocs, thus reducing the possibility of hydrophilic organics and broken flocs entering and blocking the membrane pores. In addition, the FT-IR spectral changes before and after the floc breakage were analyzed by 2D-COS technique in this study, and it was found for the first time that the participation of MNBs in the coagulation process could change the sequence of functional group transformation within the floc, and promote the generation of hydrogen bonds between flocs by hindering the generation of hydroxyl groups (-OH), and improve the shear resistance and regrowth capacity of flocs while reducing the possibility of broken flocs entering and blocking membrane pores. In summary, the MC-UF process proposed in this study can significantly mitigate ultrafiltration membrane fouling while meeting cleaning production, providing theoretical support for the application of the process to practical engineering.",2023,12,18
The effect of marijuana use in adolescence on college and graduate degree attainment.,We estimate the long-term effect of using marijuana in adolescence on college and graduate degree attainment measured approximately 20 years later. We rely on the first two waves (1994-1996) and the fifth wave (2016-2018) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health and estimate instrumental variables models that exploit the network structure at the second degree by using marijuana use status of friends of friends who are not themselves friends of the respondent in order to instrument for the respondent's marijuana use. Our models also include school and grade fixed effects. Marijuana use in adolescence leads to a large reduction in the likelihood of college and graduate degree attainment by the time respondents are aged 33-43 years old.,2023,12,26

AgInS<sub>2</sub>-Embedded Photocatalytic Membrane: Insights into the Excited State and Electron Transfer Dynamics.,"Photocatalytic reactions at semiconductor nanocrystal surfaces are useful for synthesizing value-added chemicals using sunlight. Semiconductor nanocrystals dispersed in a rigid framework, such as polymer film, can mitigate issues such as aggregation, product separation, and other challenges that are usually encountered in suspensions or slurries. Using a cation exchange technique, we successfully embedded AgInS<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles into a Nafion matrix, termed AgInS<sub>2</sub>-Nafion. This was achieved through a galvanic exchange between In and Ag in In<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> present within the Nafion film, enabling an adjustable Ag:In ratio for optimized photophysical properties. As in the case of colloidal suspension, the AgInS<sub>2</sub> particles embedded in Nafion exhibit a long absorption tail, a broad emission band with a large Stokes shift, and emission lifetimes extending into the microseconds that are characteristic of donor-acceptor pairs, DAP. Remediation of surface states with the treatment of 3-mercaptopropionic acid resulted in significant enhancement in the emission yield. Charge carrier generation through bandgap excitation as well as activation of DAP states which reside within the bandgap is probed through transient absorption spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of AgInS<sub>2</sub>-Nafion was probed by using thionine as an electron acceptor. The electron transfer rate constant from excited AgInS<sub>2</sub> to thionine as observed from transient absorption spectroscopy was determined to be ∼6.3 × 10<sup>10</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. The design of a photoactive membrane offers new ways to carry out photocatalytic processes with greater selectivity.",2023,12,29

The authors present a cohort of patients with spinal LMS treated with either upfront surgery or upfront CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).",2023,12,29
Safety and efficacy of endovascular versus microsurgical treatment of unruptured wide-necked middle cerebral artery aneurysms: a propensity score-matched analysis of the NeuroVascular Quality Initiative Quality Outcomes Database Cerebral Aneurysm Registry.,"Unruptured, wide-necked middle cerebral artery (WN-MCA) aneurysms have traditionally been considered ideal candidates for microsurgery (MS), although endovascular treatment (EVT) has dramatically increased in popularity with the advent of novel devices such as intrasaccular flow disruptors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MS versus EVT for unruptured WN-MCA aneurysms.",2023,12,29
Electromyographic predictors of abducens nerve palsy after endoscopic skull base surgery.,"Recovery of abducens nerve palsy (ANP) after endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery (ESBS) has been shown to be potentially predicted by postoperative ophthalmological examination. Triggered electromyography (t-EMG) and free-run electromyography (f-EMG) activity provide an intraoperative assessment of abducens nerve function, but associations with long-term ANP outcomes have not been explored. The objective of this study was to describe intraoperative abducens EMG characteristics and determine whether these electrophysiological profiles are associated with immediately postoperative and long-term ANP outcomes after ESBS.",2023,12,29

B-Site Co-Doping Coupled with Additive Passivation Pushes the Efficiency of Pb-Sn Mixed Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells to Over 17.,"Pb-Sn mixed inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered increasing interest as a viable solution to mitigate the thermal instability and lead toxicity of hybrid lead-based PSCs. However, the relatively poor structural stability and low device efficiency hinder its further development. Herein, high-performance manganese (Mn)-doped Pb-Sn-Mn-based inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are successfully developed by introducing Benzhydroxamic Acid (BHA) as multifunctional additive. The incorporation of smaller divalent Mn cations contributes to a contraction of the perovskite crystal, leading to an improvement in structural stability. The BHA additive containing a reductive hydroxamic acid group (O═C-NHOH) not only mitigates the notorious oxidation of Sn<sup>2+</sup> but also interacts with metal ions at the B-site and passivates related defects. This results in films with high crystallinity and low defect density. Moreover, the BHA molecules tend to introduce a near-vertical dipole moment that parallels the built-in electric field, thus facilitating charge carrier extraction. Consequently, the resulting device delivers a champion PCE as high as 17.12%, which represents the highest reported efficiency for Pb-Sn-based inorganic PSCs thus far. Furthermore, the BHA molecule provides an in situ encapsulation of the perovskite grain boundary, resulting in significant enhancement of device air stability.",2023,12,29
Kinetic Referencing Allows Identification of Epigenetic Cytosine Modifications by Single-Molecule Hybridization Kinetics and Superresolution DNA-PAINT Microscopy.,"We develop a DNA origami-based internal kinetic referencing system with a colocalized reference and target molecule to provide increased sensitivity and robustness for transient binding kinetics. To showcase this, we investigate the subtle changes in binding strength of DNA oligonucleotide hybrids induced by cytosine modifications. These cytosine modifications, especially 5-methylcytosine but also its oxidized derivatives, have been increasingly studied in the context of epigenetics. Recently revealed correlations of epigenetic modifications and disease also render them interesting biomarkers for early diagnosis. Internal kinetic referencing allows us to probe and compare the influence of the different epigenetic cytosine modifications on the strengths of 7-nucleotide long DNA hybrids with one or two modified nucleotides by single-molecule imaging of their transient binding, revealing subtle differences in binding times. Interestingly, the influence of epigenetic modifications depends on their position in the DNA strand, and in the case of two modifications, effects are additive. The sensitivity of the assay indicates its potential for the direct detection of epigenetic disease markers.",2023,12,29
Regression-Based Active Learning for Accessible Acceleration of Ultra-Large Library Docking.,"Structure-based drug discovery is a process for both hit finding and optimization that relies on a validated three-dimensional model of a target biomolecule, used to rationalize the structure-function relationship for this particular target. An ultralarge virtual screening approach has emerged recently for rapid discovery of high-affinity hit compounds, but it requires substantial computational resources. This study shows that active learning with simple linear regression models can accelerate virtual screening, retrieving up to 90% of the top-1% of the docking hit list after docking just 10% of the ligands. The results demonstrate that it is unnecessary to use complex models, such as deep learning approaches, to predict the imprecise results of ligand docking with a low sampling depth. Furthermore, we explore active learning meta-parameters and find that constant batch size models with a simple ensembling method provide the best ligand retrieval rate. Finally, our approach is validated on the ultralarge size virtual screening data set, retrieving 70% of the top-0.05% of ligands after screening only 2% of the library. Altogether, this work provides a computationally accessible approach for accelerated virtual screening that can serve as a blueprint for the future design of low-compute agents for exploration of the chemical space via large-scale accelerated docking. With recent breakthroughs in protein structure prediction, this method can significantly increase accessibility for the academic community and aid in the rapid discovery of high-affinity hit compounds for various targets.",2023,12,29
Contiguous Silver(I)-Mediated Base Pairs of Imidazophenanthroline and Canonical Nucleobases in DNA Duplexes: Formation of Classical Duplexes versus Homodimer Formation.,"Metal-mediated base pairs represent a topical alternative to canonical hydrogen-bonded base pairs. In this context, the ligand 1<i>H</i>-imidazo[4,5-<i>f</i>][1,10]phenanthroline (<b>P</b>) was introduced as an artificial nucleobase in a glycol nucleic acid-based nucleoside analogue into a DNA oligonucleotide in a way that the oligonucleotide contains a central block of six contiguous <b>P</b> residues. The ability to engage in Ag<sup>+</sup>-mediated base pairing was evaluated with respect to the four canonical nucleosides in positions complementary to <b>P</b>. Highly stabilizing Ag<sup>+</sup>-mediated base pairs were formed with cytosine and guanine (i.e., <b>P</b>-Ag<sup>+</sup>-<b>C</b> and <b>P</b>-Ag<sup>+</sup>-<b>G</b> base pairs), whereas the analogous base pairs with thymine and adenine were much less stable and hence formed incompletely. Surprisingly, the intermediate formation of a homodimeric duplex of the <b>P</b>-containing oligonucleotide was observed in all cases, albeit to a different extent. The homodimer is composed of <b>P</b>-Ag<sup>+</sup>-<b>P</b> base pairs and 18 overhanging mismatched canonical nucleobases. It demonstrates the obstacles present when designing metal-mediated base pairs as metal complexation may take place irrespective of the surrounding natural base pairs. Homodimer formation was found to be particularly prominent when the designated metal-mediated base pairs are of low stability, suggesting that homodimers and regular duplexes are formed in a competing manner.",2023,12,29
Mean arterial pressure/norepinephrine equivalent dose index as an early measure for mortality risk in patients with shock on vasopressors.,"We aimed to investigate the association between the early mean arterial pressure (MAP)/norepinephrine equivalent dose (NEQ) index and mortality risk in patients with shock on vasopressors, and further identify the breakpoint value of the MAP/NEQ index for high mortality risk.",2023,12,29
How Positioning Wearable Haptic Interfaces on Limbs Influences Virtual Embodiment.,"With increasing use of computer applications and robotic devices in our everyday life, and with the advent of metaverse, there is an urgent need of developing new types of interfaces that facilitate a more intuitive interaction in physical and virtual space. In this work, we investigate the influence of the location of haptic feedback devices on embodiment of virtual hands and user load during an interactive pick-and-place task. To do this, we conducted a user study with a 3x2 repeated measure experiment design: feedback position is varied between the distal phalanx of the index finger and the thumb, the proximal phalanx of the index finger and the thumb, and the wrist. These conditions of feedback are tested with the stimuli applied synchronously to the participant in one case, and with an additional delay of 350 ms in the second case. The results show that the location of the haptic feedback device does not affect embodiment, whereas the delay, i.e., whether the feedback is applied synchronously or asynchronously, affects embodiment. This suggests that for pick-and-place tasks, haptic feedback devices can be placed on the user's wrist without compromising performance making the hands to remain free, allowing unobstructed hand visibility for precise motion tracking, thereby improving accuracy.",2023,12,29
The Fluoride Method: Access to Silver(III) NHC Complexes.,"We have synthesized the first silver(III) carbene complexes, (CF3)3Ag(NHC), by direct reaction of the silver(III) fluoride precursor complex [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] with different imidazolium salts. This novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. The silver(III) carbene complexes thus prepared are unprecedented and show remarkable thermal stabilities. They display square-planar or square-pyramidal geometry. Following our calculations, the electronic structure of a model representative complex exhibits Inverse Ligand Field (ILF). The compounds reported herein are synthetic analogues of the elusive difluorocarbene and carbonyl species proposed as intermediates in the acidic decomposition of [Ag(CF3)4]-. The synthetic procedure reported is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition-metals in high oxidation states.",2023,12,29

Coordinated Lipid Mobilization during Seed Development and Germination in Peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L.).,"Peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L.) is one of the most important oil crops in the world due to its lipid-rich seeds. Lipid accumulation and degradation play crucial roles in peanut seed maturation and seedling establishment, respectively. Here, we utilized lipidomics and transcriptomics to comprehensively identify lipids and the associated functional genes that are important in the development and germination processes of a large-seed peanut variety. A total of 332 lipids were identified; triacylglycerols (TAGs) and diacylglycerols were the most abundant during seed maturation, constituting 70.43 and 16.11%, respectively, of the total lipids. Significant alterations in lipid profiles were observed throughout seed maturation and germination. Notably, TAG (18:1/18:1/18:2) and (18:1/18:2/18:2) peaked at 23386.63 and 23392.43 nmol/g, respectively, at the final stage of seed development. Levels of hydroxylated TAGs (HO-TAGs) increased significantly during the initial stage of germination. Accumulation patterns revealed an inverse relationship between free fatty acids and TAGs. Lipid degradation was determined to be regulated by diacylglycerol acyltransferase, triacylglycerol lipase, and associated transcription factors, predominantly yielding oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid. Collectively, the results of this study provide valuable insights into lipid dynamics during the development and germination of large-seed peanuts, gene resources, and guiding future research into lipid accumulation in an economically important crop.",2023,12,29
State-related Electroencephalography Microstate Complexity during Propofol- and Esketamine-Induced Unconsciousness.,"Identifying the state-related ""neural correlates of consciousness"" for anesthetics-induced unconsciousness is challenging.

Anatomical substrates of Rapid Eye Movement sleep rebound in a rodent model of post-sevoflurane sleep disruption.,"Previous research suggests that sevoflurane anesthesia may prevent the brain from accessing REM sleep. If true, then patterns of neural activity observed in REM-on and REM-off neuronal populations during recovery from sevoflurane should resemble those seen after REM sleep deprivation. In this study we hypothesized that, relative to controls, animals exposed to sevoflurane present with a distinct expression pattern of c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, in a cluster of nuclei classically associated with REM sleep, and that such expression in sevoflurane -exposed and REM sleep-deprived animals is largely similar.",2023,12,29
Optical Imaging of a Single Molecule with Subnanometer Resolution by Photoinduced Force Microscopy.,"Visualizing the optical response of individual molecules is a long-standing goal in catalysis, molecular nanotechnology, and biotechnology. The molecular response is dominated not only by the electronic states in their isolated environment but also by neighboring molecules and the substrate. Information about the transfer of energy and charge in real environments is essential for the design of the desired molecular functions. However, visualizing these factors with spatial resolution beyond the molecular scale has been challenging. Here, by combining photoinduced force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy, we have mapped the photoinduced force in a pentacene bilayer with a spatial resolution of 0.6 nm and observed its ""multipole excitation"". We identified the excitation as the result of energy and charge transfer between the molecules and to the Ag substrate. These findings can be achieved only by combining microscopy techniques to simultaneously visualize the optical response of the molecules and the charge transfer between the neighboring environments. Our approach and findings provide insights into designing molecular functions by considering the optical response at each step of layering molecules.",2023,12,29
The next decade of SET: from an oncoprotein to beyond.,"This year marks the fourth decade of research into the protein SET, which was discovered in 1992. SET was initially identified as an oncoprotein, but later, it was shown to be a multifaceted protein involved in regulating numerous biological processes under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. SET dysfunction is closely associated with diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. With the increasing understanding of how SET works and how it is regulated in cells, targeting aberrant SET has emerged as a potential strategy for disease intervention. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the advancements in SET studies, encompassing its biological functions, regulatory networks, clinical implications, and pharmacological inhibitors. Furthermore, we provide insights into the future prospects of SET research, with a particular emphasis on its promising potential in the realm of immune modulation.",2023,12,29
Views of adolescents living with perinatally acquired HIV on HIV status disclosure in Eswatini.,"HIV is recognised as a multifaceted chronic disease, bearing psychosocial consequences that potentially impact on the personal and social well-being of those living with it. Adolescents and youth bear a significant proportion of the burden of the HIV epidemic but they have low rates of disclosure of their HIV status. This study aims to determine the views of adolescents living with perinatally acquired HIV on HIV status disclosure among 361 adolescents aged 15-19 in Eswatini. A cross-sectional study was conducted on adolescents who already knew their status, and data were collected using a structured questionnaire. A majority of the participants, 55% (<i>n</i> = 200), were females, and 44% (<i>n</i> = 160) were males. A low number of adolescents (22%) had disclosed their HIV status to anyone. Adolescents who found it difficult to understand disclosure themselves had low levels of onward disclosure (27%) compared to adolescents who better understood the disclosure event. Our results revealed that adolescents' prevalence of HIV status disclosure was low. This raises concerns as some of the adolescents were in relationships with partners who were not aware of their status. However, older adolescents displayed some level of disclosure self-efficacy in that a higher proportion of them disclosed better than younger adolescents.",2023,12,29
Improving Statewide Post-Operative Sepsis Performance Measurement Using Hospital Risk Adjustment Within a Surgical Collaborative.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> The Georgia Quality Improvement Program (GQIP) surgical collaborative participating hospitals have shown consistently poor performance in the post-operative sepsis category of National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data as compared with national benchmarks. We aimed to compare crude versus risk-adjusted post-operative sepsis rankings to determine high and low performers amongst GQIP hospitals. <b><i>Patients and Methods:</i></b> The cohort included intra-abdominal general surgery patients across 10 collaborative hospitals from 2015 to 2020. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) sepsis definition was used among all hospitals for case abstraction and NSQIP data were utilized to train and validate a multivariable risk-adjustment model with post-operative sepsis as the outcome. This model was used to rank GQIP hospitals by risk-adjusted post-operative sepsis rates. Rankings between crude and risk-adjusted post-operative sepsis rankings were compared ordinally and for changes in tertile. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The study included 20,314 patients with 595 cases of post-operative sepsis. Crude 30-day post-operative sepsis risk among hospitals ranged from 0.81 to 5.11. When applying the risk-adjustment model which included: age, American Society of Anesthesiology class, case complexity, pre-operative pneumonia/urinary tract infection/surgical site infection, admission status, and wound class, nine of 10 hospitals were re-ranked and four hospitals changed performance tertiles. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Inter-collaborative risk-adjusted post-operative sepsis rankings are important to present. These metrics benchmark collaborating hospitals, which facilitates best practice exchange from high to low performers.",2023,12,29
"Spatial-temporal risk clusters, social vulnerability, and identification of priority areas for surveillance and control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Maranhão, Brazil: an ecological study.","Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected disease widely distributed in Maranhão, Brazil and presents a significant public health problem. However, its transmission dynamics and determining factors are not clearly understood. In this context, geospatial technologies help interpret the process. This study, then, characterized the space-time dynamics and the influence of social vulnerability on CL in an endemic area in Northeast Brazil. This is an ecological study about new cases of CL in Maranhão, from 2007 to 2020, obtained directly from the Notifiable Diseases Information System. The incidence rate was smoothed using a spatial empirical Bayesian method. Subsequently, global and local Moran statistics and their association with social vulnerability indicators were determined. Disease distribution was not random but grouped in space and time. All Social Vulnerability Index domains were positively correlated with the CL incidence. A likely cluster was detected in western Maranhão (P < 0.001), which encompassed 18 municipalities, from January 2007 to December 2013, with a high relative risk (5.06). The research findings suggest that planning public health actions and allocating resources should be prioritized in these areas to help effectively reduce the incidence of the disease.",2023,12,29
Bioinspired Amino Acid Based Materials in Bionanotechnology: From Minimalistic Building Blocks and Assembly Mechanism to Applications.,"Inspired by natural hierarchical self-assembly of proteins and peptides, amino acids, as the basic building units, have been shown to self-assemble to form highly ordered structures through supramolecular interactions. The fabrication of functional biomaterials comprised of extremely simple biomolecules has gained increasing interest due to the advantages of biocompatibility, easy functionalization, and structural modularity. In particular, amino acid based assemblies have shown attractive physical characteristics for various bionanotechnology applications. Herein, we propose a review paper to summarize the design strategies as well as research advances of amino acid based supramolecular assemblies as smart functional materials. We first briefly introduce bioinspired reductionist design strategies and assembly mechanism for amino acid based molecular assembly materials through noncovalent interactions in condensed states, including self-assembly, metal ion mediated coordination assembly, and coassembly. In the following part, we provide an overview of the properties and functions of amino acid based materials toward applications in nanotechnology and biomedicine. Finally, we give an overview of the remaining challenges and future perspectives on the fabrication of amino acid based supramolecular biomaterials with desired properties. We believe that this review will promote the prosperous development of innovative bioinspired functional materials formed by minimalistic building blocks.",2023,12,29
Protein sequence design on given backbones with deep learning.,"Deep learning methods for protein sequence design focus on modeling and sampling the many- dimensional distribution of amino acid sequences conditioned on the backbone structure. To produce physically foldable sequences, inter-residue couplings need to be considered properly. These couplings are treated explicitly in iterative methods or autoregressive methods. Non-autoregressive models treating these couplings implicitly are computationally more efficient, but still await tests by wet experiment. Currently, sequence design methods are evaluated mainly using native sequence recovery rate and native sequence perplexity. These metrics can be complemented by sequence-structure compatibility metrics obtained from energy calculation or structure prediction. However, existing computational metrics have important limitations that may render the generalization of computational test results to performance in real applications unwarranted. Validation of design methods by wet experiments should be encouraged.",2023,12,29

"Microwave Encounters Ionic Liquid: Synergistic Mechanism, Synthesis and Emerging Applications.","Progress in microwave (MW) energy application technology has stimulated remarkable advances in manufacturing and high-quality applications of ionic liquids (ILs) that are generally used as novel media in chemical engineering. This Review focuses on an emerging technology via the combination of MW energy and the usage of ILs, termed microwave-assisted ionic liquid (MAIL) technology. In comparison to conventional routes that rely on heat transfer through media, the contactless and unique MW heating exploits the electromagnetic wave-ions interactions to deliver energy to IL molecules, accelerating the process of material synthesis, catalytic reactions, and so on. In addition to the inherent advantages of ILs, including outstanding solubility, and well-tuned thermophysical properties, MAIL technology has exhibited great potential in process intensification to meet the requirement of efficient, economic chemical production. Here we start with an introduction to principles of MW heating, highlighting fundamental mechanisms of MW induced process intensification based on ILs. Next, the synergies of MW energy and ILs employed in materials synthesis, as well as their merits, are documented. The emerging applications of MAIL technologies are summarized in the next sections, involving tumor therapy, organic catalysis, separations, and bioconversions. Finally, the current challenges and future opportunities of this emerging technology are discussed.",2023,12,29
Improved bioimpedance spectroscopy tissue classification through data augmentation from generative adversarial networks.,"Bioimpedance spectroscopy is a tissue classification technique with many clinical applications. Similarly to other data-driven methods, it requires large amounts of data to accurately distinguish similar classes of tissue. Classifiers trained on small datasets typically suffer from over-fitting and lack the ability to generalise to previously unseen data. However, a large in or ex vivo spectral database is difficult to attain. Data collection is usually limited to studies that occur infrequently, and publicly available data is often not available. A solution to this problem is to artificially increase the training dataset by creating modified, yet accurate, copies of the original dataset. The most common techniques in spectral classification are to add noise to copies of the original data, over-sample it, or randomly interpolate pairs of the original data. However, simply perturbing or interpolating the data does not guarantee that the new dataset captures the key features of the original data needed for accurate classification. This study proposes a novel way to augment bioimpedance spectral data. It uses generative adversarial networks (GAN)-a model in which two neural networks (NN) compete with each other: while one NN artificially manufactures data that could be mistaken for real data, the role of the second NN is to identify which data it receives has been artificially created. The first NN then interactively adapts its output until the second NN can no longer flag artificially created data. The result is a new dataset that truly represents the features of the original data. In this study, three GAN architectures are used, i.e., the vanilla GAN, the deep convolutional GAN, and the Wasserstein GAN. Then, the generated data is used to train five classification methods, and their results are compared to a baseline that only uses the original data. The results from a dataset of 13 different tissue classes show that the deep convolutional GAN is most statistically similar to the original data and improves classification accuracy by 15% when compared to the same model trained only on the original data. The Wasserstein-GAN architecture also provides significant improvements of up to 24% better accuracy.",2023,12,29
Role of rs2366152 single-nucleotide variant located in the long noncoding RNA HOTAIR gene in the cervical cancer susceptibility in a Polish population.,"Previous studies have demonstrated an association of the NC_000012.12:g.53962605A > G, (rs2366152) single-nucleotide variant (SNV) situated in the long noncoding homeobox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) gene with HPV16-related cervical cancer pathogenesis. However, little is known about the role of rs2366152 in cervical cancer progression and how oral birth control pills use, parity, menopausal status, and cigarette smoking influence the role of rs2366152 in cervical carcinogenesis. HRM analysis was used to determine the rs2366152 SNV prevalence in patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (n = 470) and control group (n = 499) in a Polish Caucasian population. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for age, using birth control pills, parity, menopausal status, and cigarette smoking. Our genetic studies revealed that the G/A vs. A/A (p = 0.031, p = 0.002) and G/A + G/G vs. A/A (p = 0.035, p = 0.003) genotypes of rs2366152 SNV were significantly related to the grade of differentiation G3 and tumor stage III, respectively. Moreover, cervical cancer risk increased among patients with rs2366152 SNV who smoked cigarettes and used birth control pills. We conclude that rs2366152 may promote the invasion and rapid growth of cervical SCC. Moreover, rs2366152 with cigarette smoking and using birth control pills can also be a risk factor for cervical cancerogenesis.",2023,12,29
Cytokine storm and translating IL-6 biology into effective treatments for COVID-19.,"As of May 3, 2023, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in more than 760 million confirmed cases and over 6.9 million deaths. Several patients have developed pneumonia, which can deteriorate into acute respiratory distress syndrome. The primary etiology may be attributed to cytokine storm, which is triggered by the excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines and subsequently leads to immune dysregulation. Considering that high levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been detected in several highly pathogenic coronavirus-infected diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002, the Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012, and COVID-19, the IL-6 pathway has emerged as a key in the pathogenesis of this hyperinflammatory state. Thus, we review the history of cytokine storm and the process of targeting IL-6 signaling to elucidate the pivotal role played by tocilizumab in combating COVID-19.",2023,12,29

Practice and principle of traditional Chinese medicine for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.,"Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has played an important role in the prevention and treatment of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in China. The integration of Chinese and Western medicine is an important feature of Chinese COVID-19 prevention and treatment. According to a series of evidence-based studies, TCM can reduce the infection rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in high-risk groups. For patients with mild and moderate forms of COVID-19, TCM can relieve the related signs and symptoms, shorten the period of nucleic-acid negative conversion, and reduce conversion rate to the severe form of the disease. For COVID-19 patients with severe and critical illnesses, TCM can improve inflammatory indicators and blood oxygen saturation, shorten the hospital stay, and reduce the mortality rate. During recovery, TCM can improve patients' symptoms, promote organ function recovery, boost the quality of patients' life, and reduce the nucleic-acid repositive conversion rate. A series of mechanism research studies revealed that capability of TCM to treat COVID-19 through antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects, immune regulation, and protection of organ function via a multicomponent, multitarget, and multipathway approach.",2023,12,29

Diet analysis and the assessment of plastic and other indigestible anthropogenic litter in the white stork pellets.,"Pollution by anthropogenic litter is a major threat to global ecosystems. Seabirds are frequently used as environmental monitors of litter ingestion, but similar research is rare for terrestrial birds. Here, we focused on pellet analysis from 117 nests of an iconic bird of the Western Palearctic, the white stork (Ciconia ciconia), breeding in southern and southwestern Poland in a farmland landscape, far away from large dumps and landfills. We found that most prey items in the diet of white storks were invertebrates (particularly from orders Coleoptera, Orthoptera, and Hymenoptera) but vertebrate prey comprised most of the biomass. Further analysis revealed that anthropogenic litter was found in 22.7% of pellets (34.2% of breeding pairs) with plastic (8.4%) and cigarette filters (6.9%) being most prevalent. This study represents the first assessment through pellet analysis of the ingestion of anthropogenic litter by live wild storks in Poland and also by a migratory population of white storks. Our study indicates a potentially significant transfer of plastic and other anthropogenic material through terrestrial food webs.",2023,12,29
Fluoranthene adsorption by graphene oxide and magnetic chitosan composite (mCS/GO).,"The oil industry faces the challenge of reducing its high polluting potential, due to the presence of aromatic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Efforts have been made to mitigate the impact of PAHs in industry through the development of detection technologies and the implementation of mitigation strategies. This study presents the adsorption of fluoranthene, through a magnetic composite of graphene oxide and chitosan as a method of remediation of produced water. The efficiency of the process was evaluated through kinetic, equilibrium, thermodynamic, and characterization analyses. The nanocomposite was able to remove 90.9% of FLT after 60 min and showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 28.22 mg/g, demonstrating that they can be implemented to remove fluoranthene. Kinetic and equilibrium experimental data showed that physisorption is the predominant adsorptive mechanism; however, the process is also influenced by chemisorption, which occurs through electrostatic interactions between the surface of the material and the adsorbate. The thermodynamic study showed that fluoranthene and graphene composite have high affinity, and that the adsorption is exothermic and spontaneous. The results presented in this paper indicate that the magnetic composite is a potential and sustainable adsorbent for fluoranthene remediation.",2023,12,29

Roles of astrocytes and prions in Alzheimer's disease: insights from mathematical modeling.,"We present a mathematical model that explores the progression of Alzheimer's disease, with a particular focus on the involvement of disease-related proteins and astrocytes. Our model consists of a coupled system of differential equations that delineates the dynamics of amyloid beta plaques, amyloid beta protein, tau protein, and astrocytes. Amyloid beta plaques can be considered fibrils that depend on both the plaque size and time. We change our mathematical model to a temporal system by applying an integration operation with respect to the plaque size. Theoretical analysis including existence, uniqueness, positivity, and boundedness is performed in our model. We extend our mathematical model by adding two populations, namely prion protein and amyloid beta-prion complex. We characterize the system dynamics by locating biologically feasible steady states and their local stability analysis for both models. The characterization of the proposed model can help inform in advancing our understanding of the development of Alzheimer's disease as well as its complicated dynamics. We investigate the global stability analysis around the interior equilibrium point by constructing a suitable Lyapunov function. We validate our theoretical analysis with the aid of extensive numerical illustrations.",2023,12,29
A novel pulsed field ablation system using linear and spiral ablation catheters can create large and durable endocardial and epicardial ventricular lesions in vivo.,"We investigated the preclinical safety and efficacy of ventricular pulsed field ablation (PFA) using a family of novel, 6-/8-Fr, linear, and spiral PFA/mapping catheters (CRC EP, Inc).",2023,12,29
The Role of ICP Monitoring in Minimally Invasive Surgery for the Management of Intracerebral Hemorrhage.,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the second major stroke type, with high incidence, high disability rate, and high mortality. At present, there is no effective and reliable treatment for ICH. As a result, most patients have a poor prognosis. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is the fastest treatment method to remove hematoma, which is characterized by less trauma and easy operation. Some studies have confirmed the safety of MIS, but there are still no reports showing that it can significantly improve the functional outcome of ICH patients. Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is considered to be an important part of successful treatment in traumatic brain diseases. By monitoring ICP in real time, keeping stable ICP could help patients with craniocerebral injury get a good prognosis. In the course of MIS treatment of ICH patients, keeping ICP stable may also promote patient recovery. In this review, we will take ICP monitoring as the starting point for an in-depth discussion.",2023,12,29
Supervisory Alliance as a Moderator of the Effects of Behavioral Rehearsal on TF-CBT Fidelity: Results from a Randomized Trial of Supervision Strategies.,"Exposure is an important element of treatment for many evidence-based treatments but can be challenging to implement. Supervision strategies to support exposure delivery may be an important tool to facilitate the use of exposure techniques; however, they must be considered and used in the context of the supervisory alliance. The present study examined relations between supervisory alliance and fidelity to the trauma narrative (TN; i.e., imaginal exposure) component of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. We also examined how supervisory alliance moderated the effect of behavioral rehearsal use in supervision on TN fidelity. We analyzed data from a randomized controlled trial, in which forty-two supervisors and their clinicians (N = 124) from 28 Washington State community-based mental health offices participated. Clinicians were randomized to receive one of two supervision conditions-symptom and fidelity monitoring (SFM) or SFM with behavioral rehearsal (SFM + BR). Supervisory alliance alone did not predict delivery (i.e., occurrence) or extensiveness of delivery of the trauma narrative. Client-focused supervisory alliance moderated the effectiveness of behavioral rehearsal-as client-focused alliance increased, the odds of delivering the TN also increased significantly. Future research should further investigate how to appropriately match supervision techniques with supervisory dyads and explore the interplay of alliance with supervision techniques a supervisor might employ.",2023,12,29
Does Anxiety Systematically Bias Estimates of Executive Functioning Deficits in Pediatric Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder?,"Growing evidence suggests that childhood ADHD is associated with larger impairments in working memory relative to inhibition. However, most studies have not considered the role of co-occurring anxiety on these estimates - a potentially significant confound given prior evidence that anxiety may increase working memory difficulties but decrease inhibition difficulties for these children. The current study extends prior work to examine the extent to which co-occurring anxiety may be systematically affecting recent estimates of the magnitude of working memory/inhibitory control deficits in ADHD. The carefully-phenotyped sample included 197 children with ADHD and 142 children without ADHD between the ages of 8 and 13 years (N = 339; M<sub>age</sub> = 10.31, SD = 1.39; 144 female participants). Results demonstrated that ADHD diagnosis predicted small impairments in inhibitory control (d = 0.31) and large impairments in working memory (d = 0.99). However, child trait anxiety assessed dimensionally across multiple informants (child, parent, teacher) did not uniquely predict either executive function, nor did it moderate estimates of ADHD-related working memory/inhibition deficits. When evaluating anxiety categorically and controlling for ADHD, anxiety diagnosis predicted slightly better working memory (d = 0.19) but not inhibitory control for clinically evaluated children generally. Findings from the current study indicate that trait anxiety, measured dimensionally or categorically, does not differentially affect estimates of executive dysfunction in pediatric ADHD. Further, results suggest that trait anxiety is generally not associated with executive dysfunction above and beyond the impact of co-occurring ADHD. Future research is needed to further assess the role of anxiety in ADHD behavioral symptomatology, neurocognitive functioning, and mechanisms underlying these relations.",2023,12,29
Mutation of TRPML1 Channel and Pathogenesis of Neurodegeneration in Haimeria.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, a group of debilitating disorders, have garnered increasing attention due to their escalating prevalence, particularly among aging populations. Alzheimer's disease (AD) reigns as a prominent exemplar within this category, distinguished by its relentless progression of cognitive impairment and the accumulation of aberrant protein aggregates within the intricate landscape of the brain. While the intricate pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has been the subject of extensive investigation, recent scientific inquiry has unveiled a novel player in this complex scenario-transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) channels. This comprehensive review embarks on an exploration of the intricate interplay between TRPML1 channels and neurodegenerative diseases, with an explicit spotlight on Alzheimer's disease. It immerses itself in the intricate molecular mechanisms governing TRPML1 channel functionality and elucidates their profound implications for the well-being of neurons. Furthermore, the review ventures into the realm of therapeutic potential, pondering the possibilities and challenges associated with targeting TRPML1 channels as a promising avenue for the amelioration of neurodegenerative disorders. As we traverse this multifaceted terrain of neurodegeneration and the enigmatic role of TRPML1 channels, we embark on a journey that not only broadens our understanding of the intricate machinery governing neuronal health but also holds promise for the development of innovative therapeutic interventions in the relentless battle against neurodegenerative diseases.",2023,12,29
The Pulsed Nd:YAG Laser Therapy Enhanced Nerve Regeneration via Apoptosis Inhibition in a Rat Crushed Sciatic Nerve Model.,"The study was aimed to validate the efficacy of the pulsed Nd:YAG laser on nerve regeneration in a rat sciatic nerve crushed model. 54 Wistar rats were randomly assigned into three groups: shame control, crush control, and laser treated group. For the laser treated group, the pulsed Nd:YAG laser (10 Hz) with 350 mJ per pulse in energy density and 50 J/cm<sup>2</sup> in fluence was applied extracorporeally at the lesion site for 12 min to daily deliver 500 J immediately and consecutive 9 days following the crush injury. At week 1, the apoptosis-related activities in the injured nerve were examined (n = 8/each group). The sciatic functional index (SFI) was measured preoperatively and weekly until 4 weeks after the index procedure. The injured nerve and the innervated gastrocnemius muscle histology were assessed at week 4 (n = 10/each group). At week 1, the laser group showed the significant less TUNEL-positive ratio (P < 0.05), and the lower expression of cleaved caspase3/procaspase-3 and beclin-2/beclin-2-associated protein X ratios compared with the crush control. Furthermore, the laser group revealed significantly better SFI since week 1 and throughout the study (P < 0.05, all) compared with the crush control. At week 4, the laser group showed significantly higher axon density, lower myelin g-ratio, and the corresponding higher glycogen expression (P < 0.05, all) in the gastrocnemius muscle compared with those in the crush control. The pulsed Nd:YAG might enhance the injured nerve regeneration via apoptosis inhibition.",2023,12,29
The effect of various surface treatments on the repair bond strength of denture bases produced by digital and conventional methods.,"There is limited information on the repairability of prostheses produced with digital technology. This study aims to evaluate various surface treatments on flexural bond strength of repaired dentured base resins produced by digital and conventional methods. A total of 360 samples were prepared from one heat-polymerized, one CAD/CAM milled and one 3D printed denture base materials. All of the test samples were subjected to thermocycling (5-55 °C, 5000 cycles) before and after repair with auto-polymerizing acrylic resin. The test samples were divided into five subgroups according to the surface treatment: grinding with silicon carbide (SC), sandblasting with Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (SB), Er:YAG laser (L), plasma (P) and negative control (NC) group (no treatment). In addition, the positive control (PC) group consisted of intact samples for the flexural strength test. Surface roughness measurements were performed with a profilometer. After repairing the test samples, a universal test device determined the flexural strength values. Both the surface topography and the fractured surfaces of samples were examined by SEM analysis. The elemental composition of the tested samples was analyzed by EDS. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were performed for statistical analysis of data. SB and L surface treatments statistically significantly increased the surface roughness values of all three materials compared to NC subgroups (p < 0.001). The flexural strength values of the PC groups in all three test materials were significantly higher than those of the other groups (p < 0.001). The repair flexural strength values were statistically different between the SC-SB, L-SB, and NC-SB subgroups for the CAD/CAM groups, and the L-SC and L-NC subgroups for the 3D groups (p < 0.001). The surface treatments applied to the CAD/CAM and heat-polymerized groups did not result in a statistically significant difference in the repair flexural strength values compared to the NC groups (p > 0.05). Laser surface treatment has been the most powerful repair method for 3D printing technique. Surface treatments led to similar repair flexural strengths to untreated groups for CAD/CAM milled and heat-polymerized test samples.",2023,12,29
Relationship between serum endothelin-1 and in-stent restenosis following vertebral artery stenting.,"The study objective was to investigate the relations between serum endothelin-1 and in-stent restenosis in vertebral artery stenting. Sixty-eight patients undergoing re-examination of vertebral artery stenting in the Department of Cerebrovascular Disease, Hangzhou Third People's Hospital, between April 2019 and October 2022, were invited to participate. According to the presence of vertebral artery stenting, patients were divided into the restenosis (n = 19) or non-restenosis (n = 49) groups. General clinical data and endothelin-1 levels were compared between the groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relations between endothelin-1 level and risk for in-stent restenosis. Receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn to test the diagnostic value of serum endothelin-1 level for in-stent restenosis. Compared with the non-restenosis group, restenosis group levels of low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and endothelin-1 were significantly higher (p < 0.05) Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that endothelin-1, stent length, and low-density lipoprotein were independently associated with in-stent restenosis (odds ratio = 1.502, 95% confidence interval: 0.042 ~ 0.212, p = 0.000; odds ratio = 1.899, 95% confidence interval: 1.116 ~ 2.237, p = 0.000; odds ratio = 1.899, 95% confidence interval: 1.228 ~ 3.337, p = 0.001, respectively). Area under the curve for serum endothelin-1 in the diagnosis of vertebral artery in-stent restenosis was 0.938. The best diagnostic cut-off value was 11.94 ng/L. Sensitivity was 89.5%. Specificity was 85.7%. These cumulative data indicate that endothelin-1 level is independently associated with in-stent restenosis.",2023,12,29
Evaluating the Interrater Reliability of the Icelandic Version of K-SADS-PL DSM-5.,"The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL) is a valuable tool for diagnosing mental disorders in children and adolescents. Previous studies have examined its interrater reliability, but there is limited information on individual disorders, on the updated DSM-5 version. This study aims to analyse the interrater reliability of the Icelandic translation of K-SADS-PL, DSM-5 version. K-SADS-PL was administered to a clinical sample of outpatients from the Icelandic Anxiety Centre for Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults, and The Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Landspítali, the National University Hospital in Reykjavík, Iceland. In total, 135 patients aged 6-18 were included in this study. We assessed the interrater reliability using Cohen's κ, with results ranging from poor to excellent (0.3-1.0), though most disorders showed excellent reliability (κ > 0.75). The Icelandic translation of the DSM-5 K-SADS-PL is generally reliable when used by properly trained post-graduate students, which supports its use in clinical settings.",2023,12,29

Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Inhibitors and Cardiovascular Risk in Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by an increased risk of cardiovascular events, due to the complex interplay between traditional and disease-related risk factors. Chronic inflammation and persistent disease activity are the key determinants of this risk, but despite great improvement in the disease management and prognosis, cardiovascular events are still the main cause of morbidity and mortality in RA cohorts<sup>1</sup>. In the last decades, the advent of new biological and targeted-synthetic DMARDs was accompanied by an improvement in disease activity control, but the role of each class of drugs on CVD risk is still a matter a debate. Since their approval for RA treatment, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors have been widely investigated to better understand their effects on cardiovascular outcomes. The hypothesis that the reduction of chronic inflammation with any treatment may reduce the cardiovascular risk has been recently confuted by the direct comparison of TNFα-inhibitors and JAK inhibitors in patients with RA and coexisting risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this literature review is to add to the available evidence to analyze the relationship between TNFα-inhibitors and CVD risk in patients with RA and also provide some clinical scenarios to better explain the treatment dilemmas. In particular, while data on major cardiovascular events and thromboembolism seem consistent with an inflammation-mediated benefit with TNFα-inhibitors, there remain concerns about the use of this class of bDMARDs in patients with chronic heart failure.",2023,12,29
Rhodamine-based Fluorescent Probe With Quick Response and High Selectivity for Imaging Labile Ferrous Iron in Living Cells and Zebrafish.,"The transition between its various oxidation states of Iron plays a crucial part in various chemical transformation of cells. Misregulation of iron can give rise to the iron-catalyzed reactive oxygen species disorder which have been linked to a variety of diseases, so it is crucial to monitor the labile iron pool in vivo for clinical diagnosis. According to iron autoxidation and hydrogen abstraction reaction, we reported a novel ""off-on"" fluorescent probe to response to ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) both in solutions and biological systems. The probe responds to Fe<sup>2+</sup> with good selectivity toward competing metal ions. What's more, the probe presents significant fluorescent enhancement to Fe<sup>2+</sup> in less than 1 min, making real-time sensing in biological system possible. The applications of the probe in bioimaging revealed the changes in labile iron pool by iron autoxidation or diverse stimuli.",2023,12,29

"[Psychiatric, socio-legal and perioperative aspects of vaginoplasty].","The number of scientific papers on gender-confirming surgeries as well as the surgeries themselves have increased by leaps and bounds in recent years. This leads to sometimes considerable waiting times for people seeking treatment. Social media and the internet do not always provide reliable and high-quality information. Therefore, it is necessary that both surgically and conservatively active urologists are familiar with topics regarding transgender persons. The establishment of structured training, the guarantee of minimum quality standards in the treatment of transgender persons and the further education and training of medical staff pose particular challenges. The German Society for Urology (DGU) and the German Society for Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery (DGPRÄC) have already founded their own working groups on the surgical side, which coordinate their work. Under the auspices of the professional societies DGU and DGPRÄC, a guideline on surgical procedures for gender incongruence was developed under the umbrella of the AWMF (""Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften"") which is currently being finalised. For a long time, the health care of transgender people has been moving in a field of tension between the right of self-determination of those seeking treatment, on the one hand, and the fear of making the wrong medical decisions, on the other. In contrast to most other conditions in urology, the goal of treatment is largely determined by the person seeking treatment and does not necessarily follow predetermined schedules or content. The treatment should primarily aim at reducing the individual's suffering and promoting quality of life.",2023,12,29
"The use of recombinant K39, KMP11, and crude antigen-based indirect ELISA as a serological diagnostic tool and a measure of exposure for cutaneous leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka.","Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Sri Lanka is caused by Leishmania donovani, a parasite widely known to cause visceral leishmaniasis. Despite the fact that CL is not generally believed to elicit serological immune responses, recent studies show the presence of antibody responses against this atypical form of CL. This study assesses the potential of using recombinant K39 (rK39), KMP11, and crude parasite antigen-based indirect ELISAs as serological diagnostic tools and measures of exposure for CL in Sri Lanka. The study used serum samples from confirmed CL patients (n = 266) and apparently healthy individuals from endemic settings (n = 411). Serum samples from individuals residing in non-endemic areas were used as negative controls. In-house indirect ELISAs were optimized and validated for recombinant antigens. Previously validated crude parasite extract-based indirect ELISA was performed for comparison. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v26.0. The rK39 (sensitivity = 71.2%, specificity = 64%) and KMP11 (sensitivity = 79.2%, specificity = 71.4%) based indirect ELISA were shown to be less suitable for the diagnosis of CL, while crude parasite extract-based indirect ELISA (sensitivity = 82.4%, specificity = 85.7%) might be a better method of diagnosis. All 03 ELISAs seemed to be good methods as measures of exposure since correlations were observed between the seropositivity of all 03 ELISAs (rK39: p = 0.037, KMP11: p = 0.007, CrudeAg: p = 0.000) with provincial case incidences. The findings will be important in identifying the disease hotspots in order to design the control measures for CL induced by L. donovani in Sri Lanka.",2023,12,29
Nucleic acid aptasensor with magnetically induced self-assembly for the detection of EpCAM glycoprotein.,"A ""turn-on"" aptasensor for label-free and cell-free EpCAM detection was constructed by employing magnetic α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Au nanocomposites as a matrix for signal amplification and double-stranded complex (SH-DNA/Apt probes) immobilization through Au-S binding. α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Au could be efficiently assembled into uniform and stable self-assembly films via magnetic-induced self-assembly technique on a magnetic glassy carbon electrode (MGCE). The effectiveness of the platform for EpCAM detection was confirmed through differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Under optimized conditions, the platform exhibited excellent specificity for EpCAM, and a strong linear correlation was observed between the current and the logarithm of EpCAM protein concentration in the range 1 pg/mL-1000 pg/mL (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9964), with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.27 pg/mL. Furthermore, the developed platform demonstrated good stability during a 14-day storage test, with fluctuations remaining below 93.33% of the initial current value. Promising results were obtained when detecting EpCAM in spiked serum samples, suggesting its potential as a point-of-care (POC) testing.",2023,12,29

A point-of-care aptasensor based on the upconversion nanoparticles/MoS<sub>2</sub> FRET system for the detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.,"The rapid detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is of great significance for the diagnosis of medical infection. In view of the above, a novel aptasensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was developed. It contained aptamer-coupled upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs-apt) as a donor (excitation 980 nm) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) nanosheets as an acceptor. The upconversion fluorescence aptamer system was investigated to obtain the optimal parameters of MoS<sub>2</sub> concentration, the incubation time of UCNPs-apt/MoS<sub>2</sub> and P. aeruginosa, and pH. Based on the optimal parameters, a linear calibration equation (emission 654 nm) with a wide detection range 8.7 × 10 ~ 8.7 × 10<sup>7</sup> cfu/mL, a high coefficient of determination R<sup>2</sup> 0.9941, and a low limit of determination (LOD) 15.5 cfu/mL were established. The method was validated with P. aeruginosa infected foci of mouse wound. The advantage of this aptasensor is that analysis results can be obtained  within 1.5 h, which was much faster than that of the standard method (18-24 h). Furthermore, combined with a portable instrument, it can be used as a point-of-care testing for the early detection of P. aeruginosa infection, which is useful for selecting the correct antibiotics to achieve good therapeutic effects. Additionally, it also has a broad application prospect in food and environmental areas.",2023,12,29

The role of beta-adrenoreceptors in postoperative ileus in rats.,"The aim of the research was to evaluate the influence of antagonists of specific beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes on bowel motility following abdominal surgery in rat model of postoperative ileus. Bowel motility was measured by the intestinal transit of Evans blue introduced via orogastric tube after surgical procedures of skin incision, laparotomy and laparotomy with gut manipulation. Male rats were given individual adrenergic receptor subtypes antagonists intraperitoneally, and the influence of administered agents on intestinal transit of Evans blue was then evaluated. No statistically significant differences in the length of intestine in tested rats were observed. Propranolol administered prior to surgical procedure has shown protective effect on Evans blue migration in rats undergoing laparotomy and gut manipulation. Intestinal dye transit for propranolol doses of 10, 30 and 45 mg/kg was 18.00 ± 1.88c m, 23.75 ± 1.71 cm and 22.5 ± 2.43 cm, respectively, and for last two doses, statistically significant increase of dye passage was noted, compared to Evans blue transit of 11.00 ± 2.43 cm in the control group. No acceleration of dye migration was seen following administration of beta1-, beta2- and beta3-selective adrenergic receptor antagonist metoprolol, ICI 118.551 and SR58894A, respectively. Our research confirmed that propranolol at high doses, as seen by other researchers, improved bowel motility in early phase of postoperative ileus. That slight acceleration of intestinal dye transit after surgery with gut manipulation is rather connected with membrane-stabilizing action, than the receptor blocking effect, as this effect was not observed after the application of selective antagonists of respective subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptor.",2023,12,29
Identifying heat thresholds for South Africa towards the development of a heat-health warning system.,"Exposure to heatwaves may result in adverse human health impacts. Heat alerts in South Africa are currently based on defined temperature-fixed threshold values for large towns and cities. However, heat-health warning systems (HHWS) should incorporate metrics that have been shown to be effective predictors of negative heat-related health outcomes. This study contributes to the development of a HHWS for South Africa that can potentially minimize heat-related mortality. Distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) were used to assess the association between maximum and minimum temperature and diurnal temperature range (DTR) and population-adjusted mortality during summer months, and the effects were presented as incidence rate ratios (IRR). District-level thresholds for the best predictor from these three metrics were estimated with threshold regression. The mortality dataset contained records of daily registered deaths (n = 8,476,532) from 1997 to 2013 and data for the temperature indices were for the same period. Maximum temperature appeared to be the most statistically significant predictor of all-cause mortality with strong associations observed in 40 out of 52 districts. Maximum temperature was associated with increased risk of mortality in all but three of the districts. Our results also found that heat-related mortality was influenced by regional climate because the spatial distribution of the thresholds varied according to the climate zones across the country. On average, districts located in the hot, arid interior provinces of the Northern Cape and North West experienced some of the highest thresholds compared to districts located in temperate interior or coastal provinces. As the effects of climate change become more significant, population exposure to heat is increasing. Therefore, evidence-based HHWS are required to reduce heat-related mortality and morbidity. The exceedance of the maximum temperature thresholds provided in this study could be used to issue heat alerts as part of effective heat health action plans.",2023,12,29
Prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and traditional cardiovascular risk factors in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a real-life evidence from BioSTAR nationwide registry.,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have increased morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities. The association of CV diseases (CVD) and traditional CV risk factors has been debated, depending on patient and RA characteristics. This study aimed to find the prevalence of CVD and CV risk factors in patients with RA. A multi-center cross-sectional study was performed on RA patients using the BioSTAR (Biological and Targeted Synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs Registry) in September 2022. Socio-demographic, clinical, and follow-up data were collected. Myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disorders, congestive heart failure, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack were regarded as major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). CVD was defined as the presence of at least one clinical situation of MACE. Group 1 and Group 2 included patients with and without CVD. Prevalence rates of CVD and traditional CV risk factors were the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were the differences in the clinical characteristics between patients with and without CVD. An analysis of 724 patients with a mean age of 55.1 ± 12.8 years diagnosed with RA was conducted. There was a female preponderance (79.6%). The prevalence rate of CVD was 4.6% (n = 33). The frequencies of the diseases in the MACE category were ischemic heart disease in 27, congestive heart failure in five, peripheral vascular disorders in three, and cerebrovascular events in three patients. The patients with CVD (Group 1) were significantly male, older, and had higher BMI (p = 0.027, p < 0.001, and p = 0.041). Obesity (33.4%) and hypertension (27.2%) were the two CV risk factors most frequently. Male sex (HR = 7.818, 95% CI 3.030-20.173, p < 0.001) and hypertension (HR = 4.570, 95% CI 1.567-13.328, p = 0.005) were the independent risk factors for CVD.

Tuberous Breasts Associated with Chest Wall Deformity: A Challenging Planning for Breast Augmentation.,"Tuberous breast deformity is characterized by a deficiency in the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the breast, as well as breast underdevelopment and asymmetry. Concomitant chest wall deformities are not uncommon and increase the difficulty when planning breast augmentation in such patients. We present a unique case of tuberous breasts and chest wall deformity successfully treated employing a novel technique that incorporated breast implants and fat grafting. A 24-year-old patient with no significant past medical history presented to the plastic surgery clinic seeking correction of a severe breast asymmetry and desiring increase in breast volume. The right breast was Grolleau type 1 cup A, while the left breast was Grolleau type 3 cup C. The left hemithorax presented an accentuated prominence of the costochondral junction of 4th left rib, along with minor prominence of the 3rd and 5th left ribs. In addition, the 5th and 6th ribs were fused together. The surgical plan involved bilateral augmentation with implant and fat grafting. A 285 cc Motiva implant was placed subfascial on the right. Multiple refinements were necessary to the left breast, including areolar reduction, inframammary fold adjustment, and medial glandular modifications. A 140 cc Motiva implant was placed subfascial. Fat grafting was used in both breasts to enhance contour, projection and conceal the chest wall deformity. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and results at 3-month follow-up showed improved breast symmetry and aesthetics.Level of Evidence V This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Co-metabolic degradation and metabolite detection of hexabromocyclododecane by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1.,"Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) is a widely used brominated flame retardant; however, it is a persistent organic pollutant as well as affects the human thyroid hormones and causes cancer. However, the degradation of HBCD has received little attention from researchers. Due to its bioaccumulative and hazardous properties, an appropriate strategy for its remediation is required. In this study, we investigated the biodegradation of HBCD using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 under optimized conditions. The Box-Behnken design (BBD) was implemented for the optimization of the physical degradation parameters of HBCD. S. oneidensis MR-1 showed the best degradation performance at a temperature of 30 °C, pH 7, and agitation speed of 115 rpm, with an HBCD concentration of 1125 μg/L in mineral salt medium (MSM). The strain tolerated up to 2000 μg/L HBCD. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis identified three intermediates, including 2-bromo dodecane, 2,7,10-trimethyldodecane, and 4-methyl-1-decene. The results provide an insightful understanding of the biodegradation of HBCD by S. oneidensis MR-1 under optimized conditions and could pave the way for further eco-friendly applications. KEY POINTS: • HBCD biodegradation by Shewanella oneidensis • Optimization of HBCD biodegradation by the Box-Behnken analysis • Identification of useful metabolites from HBCD degradation.",2023,12,29
BBQ methods: Streamlined workflows for Bacterial Burden Quantification in infected cells by confocal microscopy.,"Accurate quantification of bacterial burden within macrophages, termed Bacterial Burden Quantification (BBQ), is crucial for understanding host-pathogen interactions. Various methods have been employed, each with strengths and weaknesses. This article addresses limitations in existing techniques and introduces two novel automated methods for BBQ within macrophages based on confocal microscopy data analysis. The first method refines total fluorescence quantification by incorporating filtering steps to exclude uninfected cells, while the second method calculates total bacterial volume per cell to mitigate potential biases in fluorescence-based readouts. These workflows utilize PyImageJ and Cellpose software, providing reliable, unbiased, and rapid quantification of bacterial load. The proposed workflows were validated using Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis models, demonstrating their effectiveness in accurately assessing bacterial burden. These automated workflows offer valuable tools for studying bacterial interactions within host cells and provide insights for various research applications.",2023,12,21

Fluoroether Double-Chain Phosphate Surfactants: An Exploration of Alternatives to Fluorotelomer Surfactants.,"While legacy fluorosurfactants have already been categorized as persistent organic pollutants, there appeared to be many strategies to develop alternatives. In this work, fluoroether double-chain phosphate surfactants (C72 diPAP-Na and C72 diPAP-NH<sub>4</sub>) were designed and synthesized with the initial intention of exploring the creation of new fluorosurfactants containing oxygen heteroatoms in the fluorocarbon chain segments to provide an alternative to the legacy long-chain fluorosurfactants. Furthermore, it was expected that they would even exceed the existing 6:2 fluorotelomer surfactants (6:2 diPAP-Na and 6:2 diPAP-NH<sub>4</sub>). Compared with characterizations of surface activity, foam performance, and wettability, the results showed that each of them has its own distinctive performance. Although the C72 series as new fluoroether surfactants cannot fully replace the 6:2 series of fluorosurfactants in terms of performance, there is a possibility of substitution in some aspects, which is of positive significance for further exploration to improve alternatives to legacy fluorosurfactants.",2023,12,29
Nanomaterials-Based Field-Effect Transistor for Protein Sensing: New Advances.,"It is crucial for early stage medical diagnostics to identify disease biomarkers at ultralow concentrations. A wide range of analytes can be identified using low-dimensional materials to build highly sensitive, targeted, label-free, field-effect transistor (FET) biosensors. Two-dimensional (2D) materials are preferable for high-performance biosensing because of their dramatic change in resistivity upon analyte adsorption or biomarker detection, tunable electronic properties, high surface activities, adequate stability, and layer-dependent semiconducting properties. We give a succinct overview of interesting applications for protein sensing with various architectural styles, such as 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)-based FETs that include carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene (Gr), reduced graphene oxide (rGr), 2D transition-metal carbides (MXene), and Gr/MXene heterostructures. Because it might enable individuals to perform better, this review will be an important contribution to the field of medical science.

Effect of Different Ethylene Oxide Addition Numbers on the Performance of Polyoxyethylene Tallow Amine as a Pesticide Emulsifier.,"Surfactant reduces the surface tension of liquids, resulting in improved emulsion stability, and there is great interest in pesticide additives. Ethoxylate is often used as a pesticide emulsifier. However, the degree of ethoxylation and the existence of dioxane byproducts can significantly affect the performance of emulsifiers. Here, a series of polyoxyethylene tallow amines with the addition of different numbers of ethylene oxide (EO) were synthesized and characterized. Their physical and chemical performances were measured. The ability of POEA as a surfactant to reduce water surface tension and the surface adsorption of molecules were assessed based on the static and dynamic surface tensions. The results show that the surfactant molecules preferentially form a saturated adsorption layer in solution, and the mixed-diffusion-kinetics mechanism dominates the adsorption process. With the increase of the EO addition number, the emulsifying property of POEA increases, while the wetting property gradually decreases and the contact angle increases. These results can provide a basis for the selection of pesticide additives. At the same time, the mechanism of removing dioxane by ethoxylate is described, and a simple and low-consumption method is put forward to reduce the dioxane content. It provides a new idea for the removal of dioxane.",2023,12,29
Local treatment of liver metastasis in a patient with advanced malignant melanoma: A case report.,"Melanoma is a fatal malignant tumor with a high rate of metastasis. Liver metastasis of melanoma is always associated with insensitivity to immunotherapy and a poor prognosis. However, the combination of cryoablation, which is believed to stimulate the antitumor immune response in the body, with immunotherapy can improve the therapeutic response to this condition. Herein, we present the case of a 79-year-old woman with BRAF (B-Raf proto-oncogene) wild-type melanoma who later developed liver metastasis. The patient received intravenous antiprogrammed cell death 1 antibody, which showed poor efficacy, and subsequent treatment with immunotherapy combined with cryoablation yielded a partial response. However, after the second cryoablation, the patient refused further treatment due to a fear of bleeding. Therefore, only immunotherapy was provided, which resulted in disease progression. This report demonstrates the need to consider immunotherapy plus cryoablation for the treatment of liver metastases in patients with BRAF wild-type melanoma.",2023,12,28

Phenotypic and functional differences of dendritic cells in tumor.,"Dendritic cells (DCs) are a unique class of immune cells vital to the immune system, functioning as antigen-presenting cells that play a key role in launching both cellular and humoral immune responses. They are crucial in preventing infectious diseases and regulating tumor growth. DCs can be categorized based on various criteria such as phenotype, function, and tissue location, resulting in several subgroups. Generally, DCs are divided into two primary groups: plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and conventional DCs (cDCs), which are further classified into Type I classical DCs (cDC1) and Type II classical DCs (cDC2). cDC1 cells are distinguishable by specific gene programs and associated markers, while cDC2 cells display more diversity. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate surrounding a recently identified subgroup called DC3, and whether it can be considered a distinct cell type in the maturation process of DCs remains uncertain. Most of these DC subgroups rely on the growth factor Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) for differentiation from a common DC precursor (CDP), guided by various cytokines. Although the general classification of DC subgroups is similar in both humans and mice, numerous phenotypic and functional variations exist within each subgroup. Therefore, comprehending these differences between DC subgroups in humans and mice holds the potential to significantly advance relevant research.",2023,12,28

Non-Mixture Cure Model Estimation in Bladder Cancer Patients: A Novel Approach with Exponentiated Weibull Exponential Distribution.,"Cure models are frequently used in survival analysis to account for a cured fraction in the data. When there is a cure rate present, researchers often prefer cure models over parametric models to analyse the survival data. These models enable the ability to define the probability distribution of survival durations for patients who are at risk. Various distributions can be considered for the survival times, such as Exponentiated Weibull Exponential (EWE), Exponential Exponential (EE), Weibull and lognormal distribution. The objective of this research is to choose the most appropriate distribution that accurately represents the survival times of patients who have not been cured. This will be accomplished by comparing various non-mixture cure models that are based on the EWE distribution with its sub-distributions, and distributions distinct from those belonging to the EWE distribution family.",2023,12,01

Two- and one-photon absorption spectra of aqueous thiocyanate anion highlight the role of symmetry in the condensed phase.,"We present the two-photon absorption (2PA) spectrum of aqueous thiocyanate calculated using high-level quantum-chemistry methods. The 2PA spectrum is compared to the one-photon absorption (1PA) spectrum computed using the same computational protocol. Although the two spectra probe the same set of electronic states, the intensity patterns are different, leading to an apparent red-shift of the 2PA spectrum relative to the 1PA spectrum. The presented analysis explains the intensity patterns and attributes the differences between the 1PA and 2PA spectra to the native symmetry of isolated SCN <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <semantics> <mrow><msup><mrow></mrow> <mrow><mo>-</mo></mrow> </msup> </mrow> <annotation>$$ {}^{-} $$</annotation></semantics> </math> , which influences the spectra in the low-symmetry solvated environment.

Surfaces of Atmospheric Droplet Models Probed with Synchrotron XPS on a Liquid Microjet.,"ConspectusThe atmosphere is a key part of the earth system comprising myriad chemical species in all basic forms of matter. Ubiquitous nano- and microscopic aerosol particles and cloud droplets suspended in the air play crucial roles in earth's climate and the formation of air pollution. Surfaces are a prominent part of aerosols and droplets, due to the high surface area to bulk volume ratios, but very little is known about their specific properties. Many atmospheric compounds are surface-active, leading to enhanced surface concentrations in aqueous solutions. Their distribution between the surface and bulk may determine heterogeneous chemistry and many other properties of aerosol and cloud droplets, but has not been directly observed.We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to obtain direct molecular-level information on the surface composition and structure of aqueous solutions of surface-active organics as model systems for atmospheric aerosol and cloud droplets. XPS is a vacuum-based technique enabled for volatile aqueous organic samples by the application of a high-speed liquid microjet. In combination with brilliant synchrotron X-rays, the chemical specificity of XPS allows distinction between elements in different chemical states and positions within molecular structures. We used core-level C 1s and N 1s signals to identify the alkyl and hydrophilic groups of atmospheric carboxylic acids, alkyl-amines, and their conjugate acids and bases. From this, we infer changes in the orientation of surface-adsorbed species and quantify their relative abundances in the surface. XPS-derived surface enrichments of the organics follow trends expected from their surface activities and we observed a preferential orientation at the surface with the hydrophobic alkyl chains pointing increasingly outward from the solution at higher concentrations. This provides a first direct experimental observation of well-established concepts of surface adsorption and confirms the soundness of the method.We mapped relative abundances of conjugate acid-base pairs in the aqueous solution surfaces from the respective intensities of distinctive XPS signals. For each pair, the protonation equilibrium was significantly shifted toward the neutral form in the surface, compared to the bulk solution, across the full pH range. This represents an apparent shift of the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> in the surface, which may be toward either higher or lower pH, depending on whether the acid or base form of the pair is the neutral species. The surface shifts are broadly consistent with the relative differences in surface enrichment of the individual acid and base conjugates in binary aqueous solutions, with additional contributions from nonideal interactions in the surface. In aqueous mixtures of surface-active carboxylate anions with ammonium salts at near-neutral pH, we found that the conjugate carboxylic acids were further strongly enhanced. This occurs as the coadsorption of weakly basic carboxylate anions and weakly acidic ammonium cations forms ion-pair surface layers with strongly enhanced local abundances, increasing the probability of net proton transfer according to Le Chatelier's principle. The effect is stronger when the evaporation of ammonia from the surface further contributes to irreversibly perturb the protonation equilibrium, leaving a surplus of carboxylic acid. These surface-specific effects may profoundly influence atmospheric chemistry mediated by aqueous aerosols and cloud droplets but are currently not taken into account in atmospheric models.",2023,12,29
Quality by Design Assisted Development of Luliconazole Transethosomes in Gel for the Management of <i>Candida albicans</i> Infection.,"<i>The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel vesicular formulation of luliconazole (LUL) for the management of</i> Candida albicans <i>infection through a topical route.

We explored the experiences and views of speech and language therapists (SLTs) working with people with aphasia on using telehealth to conduct assessments/outcome measures, perceived barriers and facilitators in telehealth, and their priorities for research in telehealth aphasia assessment.",2023,12,29
Multisector Collaboration vs. Social Democracy for Addressing Social Determinants of Health.,"Policy Points Multisector collaboration, the dominant approach for responding to health harms created by adverse social conditions, involves collaboration among health care insurers, health care systems, and social services organizations. Social democracy, an underused alternative, seeks to use government policy to shape the civil (e.g., civil rights), political (e.g., voting rights), and economic (e.g., labor market institutions, property rights, and the tax-and-transfer system) institutions that produce health. Multisector collaboration may not achieve its goals, both because the collaborations are difficult to accomplish and because it does not seek to transform social conditions, only to mitigate their harms. Social democracy requires political contestation but has greater potential to improve population health and health equity.",2023,12,29
Enhanced efficacy of the novel recombinant clone VasSF in a mouse model of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis.,"Based on the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) for the treatment of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), we developed a recombinant single-chain-fragment variable clone, VasSF, therapeutic against AAV in a mouse model (SCG/Kj mice). VasSF is thought to bind to vasculitis-associated apolipoprotein A-II (APOA2) as a target molecule. VasSF is a promising new drug against AAV, but difficulties in the yield and purification of VasSF remain unresolved. We produced monomers of new VasSF molecules by modifying the plasmid structure for VasSF expression and simplifying the purification method using high-performance liquid chromatography. We compared the therapeutic effects between 5-day continuous administration of the monomers, as in IVIg treatment, and single shots of 5-day-equivalent doses. We also evaluated the life-prolonging effect of the single-shot treatment. Two-dimensional Western blots were used to examine the binding of VasSF to APOA2. Our improved manufacturing method resulted in a 100-fold higher yield of VasSF than in our previous study. Monomerization of VasSF stabilized its efficacy. Single shots of a small amount (1/80,000 of IVIg) produced sufficient therapeutic effects, including decreased glomerular crescent formation, a decreasing trend of serum ANCA against myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA), decreases in multiple proinflammatory cytokines, and a trend toward prolonged survival. Two-dimensional Western blots confirmed the binding of VasSF to APOA2. The newly produced pure VasSF monomers are stable and therapeutic for AAV with a single low-dose injection, possibly by removing vasculitis-associated APOA2. Thus, the new VasSF described herein is a promising drug against AAV.",2023,12,29

Wound healing and postoperative management in paediatric patients following 27-Gauge Transconjunctival Sutureless Vitrectomy for vitreoretinal conditions.,"The utilization of 27-G TSV, or 27-Gauge Transconjunctival Sutureless Vitrectomy, poses distinct difficulties in the context of paediatric patients, particularly those younger than 14 years old, on account of the dearth of exhaustive documentation concerning the efficacy and results of these operations. Therefore, this retrospective study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 27-G TSV in paediatric patients, with emphasis on management of intraoperative and postoperative complications and postoperative wound healing. A total of 54 eyes of 52 paediatric patients who underwent 27-G TSV at Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital were included in the study. The average duration of follow-up was 9.32 ± 3.35 months. The complication with the highest incidence rate was Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment (RRD), which was detected in 27.8% cases. Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) and Persistent Fetal Vasculature (PFV) each accounted for 16.7% of the cases. Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) and Vitreous Haemorrhage (VH) constituted 11.1% and 14.8%, respectively, of the reported cases. Lens injury (1.9%), cannula slippage (7.4%) and wound leakage (5.6%) were intraoperative complications. Iatrogenic retinal detachment occurred at 3.7%. Hypotony (10.8% of patients), vitreous haemorrhage (9.3%), cataract formation (9.3%), ocular hypertension (8.1%) and retinal detachment (5.6%) were postoperative complications. Effective management strategies were executed, such as performing in situ trocar puncture to address cannula slippage and promptly suturing to address wound leakage. 27-G TSV exhibited promise as the therapeutic alternative for range of vitreoretinal disorders in paediatric patients, accompanied by complications that were controllable during and after the procedure. Strict preoperative planning and precise surgical technique are indispensable in order to maximize patient outcomes and guarantee effective wound healing and recovery within this particular demographic.",2023,12,29
Idiopathic eruptive macular pigmentation in a pediatric patient and a review of the literature.,"Idiopathic eruptive macular pigmentation (IEMP) is a rare, benign, self-resolving melanosis consisting of hyperpigmented macules typically on the face, trunk, and extremities that can occur in children and adolescents and often presents a diagnostic conundrum. We report a case involving an 8-year-old female whose previous clinical presentation was concerning for an atypical presentation of cutaneous mastocytosis or neurofibromatosis. The clinical and histopathologic evaluation was consistent with the diagnosis of IEMP, and no active intervention was pursued. Our accompanying literature review serves to better characterize this condition, highlight key diagnostic features, and emphasize the tendency for spontaneous resolution to avoid unnecessary treatments with limited clinical efficacy.",2023,12,29
Color Standardization and Stain Intensity Calibration for Whole Slide Image-Based Immunohistochemistry Assessment.,"Automated quantification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) immunohistochemistry (IHC) using whole slide imaging (WSI) is expected to eliminate subjectivity in visual assessment. However, the color intensity in WSI varies depending on the staining process and scanner device. Such variations affect the image analysis results. This paper presents methods to diminish the influence of color variation produced in the staining process using a calibrator slide consisting of peptide-coated microbeads. The calibrator slide is stained along with tissue sample slides, and the 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) color intensities of the microbeads are used for calibrating the color variation of the sample slides. An off-the-shelf image analysis tool is employed for the automated assessment, in which cells are classified by the thresholds for the membrane staining. We have adopted two methods for calibrating the color variation based on the DAB color intensities obtained from the calibrator slide: (1) thresholds for classifying the DAB membranous intensity are adjusted, and (2) the color intensity of WSI is corrected. In the experiment, the calibrator slides and tissue of breast cancer slides were stained together on different days and used to test our protocol. With the proposed protocol, the discordance in the HER2 evaluation was reduced to one slide out of 120 slides.",2023,12,29
Gut microbiota in regulation of childhood bone growth.,"Childhood stunting and wasting, or decreased linear and ponderal growth associated with undernutrition, continue to be a major global public health challenge. Although many of the current therapeutic and dietary interventions have significantly reduced childhood mortality caused by undernutrition, there remain great inefficacies in improving childhood stunting. Longitudinal bone growth in children is governed by different genetic, nutritional and other environmental factors acting systemically on the endocrine system and locally at the growth plate. Recent studies have shown that this intricate interplay between nutritional and hormonal regulation of the growth plate could involve the gut microbiota, highlighting the importance of a holistic approach in tackling childhood undernutrition. In this review, I focus on the mechanistic insights provided by these recent advances in gut microbiota research and discuss ongoing development of microbiota-based therapeutics in humans, which could be the missing link in solving undernutrition and childhood stunting.",2023,12,29

Prevalence of prescribing topical corticosteroids to patients with lichen sclerosus following surgery for vulvar cancer: a survey among gynaecologic oncologists in The Netherlands.,"Vulvar lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis which can progress to precursor lesion differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (dVIN) and vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC). The risk of developing recurrent vulvar cancer following LS-associated VSCC is high. Evidence suggests that treatment of LS with topical corticosteroids (TCS) can prevent progression to dVIN, VSCC and recurrences. However, current guidelines do not give any recommendation on the management of LS following surgery for VSCC. The aim of this study was to conduct a survey among all registered gynaecologic oncologists (GOs) in the Netherlands to evaluate the current management of LS patients without a history of VSCC (LS<sup>noVSCC</sup>) and patients with LS following surgery for VSCC (LS<sup>VSCC</sup>).",2023,12,29
The role of micrometastasis in high-risk skin cancers.,"The propensity to metastasize is the most important prognostic indicator for solid cancers. New insights into the mechanisms of early carcinogenesis have revealed micrometastases are generated far earlier than previously thought. Evidence supports a synergistic relationship between vascular and lymphatic seeding which can occur before there is clinical evidence of a primary tumour. Early vascular seeding prepares distal sites for colonisation while regional lymphatics are co-opted to promote facilitative cancer cell mutations. In response, the host mounts a global inflammatory and immunomodulatory response towards these cells supporting the concept that cancer is a systemic disease. Cancer staging systems should be refined to better reflect cancer cell loads in various tissue compartments while clinical perspectives should be broadened to encompass this view when approaching high-risk cancers. Measured adjunctive therapies implemented earlier for low-volume, in-transit cancer offers the prospect of preventing advanced disease and the need for heroic therapeutic interventions. This review seeks to re-appraise how we view the metastatic process for solid cancers. It will explore in-transit metastasis in the context of high-risk skin cancer and how it dictates disease progression. It will also discuss how these implications will influence our current staging systems and its consequences on management.",2023,12,29
Effects of temperature on metabolic rate during metamorphosis in the alfalfa leafcutting bee.,"Spring conditions, especially in temperate regions, may fluctuate abruptly and drastically. Environmental variability can expose organisms to temperatures outside of their optimal thermal ranges. For ectotherms, sudden changes in temperature may cause short- and long-term physiological effects, including changes in respiration, morphology, and reproduction. Exposure to variable temperatures during active development, which is likely to occur for insects developing in spring, can cause detrimental effects. Using the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, we aimed to determine if oxygen consumption could be measured using a new system and to test the hypothesis that female and male M. rotundata have a thermal performance curve with a wide optimal range. Oxygen consumption of M. rotundata pupae was measured across a large range of temperatures (6-48°C) using an optical oxygen sensor in a closed respirometry system. Absolute and mass-specific metabolic rates were calculated and compared between bees that were extracted from their brood cells and those remaining in the brood cell to determine whether pupae could be accurately measured inside their brood cells. The metabolic response to temperature was non-linear, which is an assumption of a thermal performance curve; however, the predicted negative slope at higher temperatures was not observed. Despite sexual dimorphism in body mass, sex differences only occurred in mass-specific metabolic rates. Higher metabolic rates in males may be attributed to faster development times, which could explain why there were no differences in absolute metabolic rate measurements. Understanding the physiological and ecological effects of thermal environmental variability on M. rotundata will help to better predict their response to climate change.",2023,12,29
Efficacy of stem cell therapy for diabetic foot: Clinical evidence from meta-analyses.,"To assess the clinical data on the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for diabetic foot (DF) based on recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRs/MAs). SRs/MAs that evaluate the clinical evidence on the efficacy of stem cell therapy for DF were identified through a systematic search in public databases. The methodological quality and evidence quality of the included SRs/MAs were assessed separately by two researchers. Eight SRs/MAs were included in this analysis. Since there were no registered protocol or exclusion criteria for the included SRs/MAs, the methodological quality was rated as critically low. There was no high-quality evidence available for the outcomes, and the evidence quality ranged from critically low to moderate. Evidence degradation was most commonly caused by the risk of bias, followed by imprecision, publication bias and inconsistency. In conclusion, stem cell therapy may be effective for DF. However, this conclusion should be approached with caution, considering the quality of the supporting SRs/MAs.",2023,12,29
A comprehensive evolutionary scenario for the origin and neofunctionalization of the Drosophila speciation gene Odysseus (OdsH).,"Odysseus (OdsH) was the first speciation gene described in Drosophila related to hybrid sterility in offspring of mating between D. mauritiana and D. simulans. Its origin is attributed to the duplication of the gene unc-4 in the subgenus Sophophora. By using a much larger sample of Drosophilidae species, we showed that contrary to what has been previously proposed, OdsH origin occurred 62 million years ago. Evolutionary rates, expression and transcription factor binding sites of OdsH evidence that it may have rapidly experienced neofunctionalization in male sexual functions. Furthermore, the analysis of the OdsH peptide allowed the identification of mutations of D. mauritiana that could result in incompatibility in hybrids. In order to find if OdsH could be related to hybrid sterility, beyond Sophophora, we explored the expression of OdsH in D. arizonae and D. mojavensis, a pair of sister species with incomplete reproductive isolation. Our data indicated that OdsH expression is not atypical in their male-sterile hybrids. In conclusion, we have proposed that the origin of OdsH occurred earlier than previously proposed, followed by neofunctionalization. Our results also suggested that its role as a speciation gene might be restricted to D. mauritiana and D. simulans.",2023,12,29

Here, we examined whether sleep disturbances mediate the association between ELA and increases in depressive symptoms during adolescence and whether this mediation differs by sex.",2023,12,29
Comparative metatranscriptomics reveals effect of host plant on microbiota gene expression of Anastrepha obliqua (Diptera: Tephritidae) larvae.,"The microbiota associated with phytophagous insects perform several functions that help insects exploit plant resources. Thus, microorganisms contribute to the dispersal of phytophagous species to new host plants, thereby promoting diversification. In this study, metatranscriptomic analysis was used to compare the gene expression of the microbiome of Anastrepha obliqua Macquart larvae feeding on 3 of its host plants: Spondias purpurea L (red mombin), Mangifera indica L (mango), and Averrhoa carambola L (starfruit). To identify differential gene expression in relation to the host plant, transcript abundance was compared. The results of the taxonomic and functional beta-diversity analysis showed that there were significant differences in the structures and activities of the microbial communities depending on the infested plant. Among the microorganisms, bacteria and fungi were active components of the microbiota. Differential expression analyses showed that the different active genes in each of the plants analyzed were mainly grouped into categories related to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, with some of these genes coding for cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase, cytochrome c, and the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase. The microbiota of A. carambola larvae differed more at the level of community structure and gene function, possibly due to the different nutritional composition of the A. carambola and the presence of a set of secondary metabolites specific to the family Oxalidaceae. In conclusion, the transcriptional activity of the microbiota of A. obliqua larvae is influenced by diet, which is important because it could influence the performance of the insect on each of its different host plants.",2023,12,29

Avian extraembryonic membranes respond to yolk corticosterone early in development.,"During times of maternal stress, developing embryos can be exposed to elevated levels of glucocorticoids which can affect development and permanently alter offspring phenotype. In placental species, the placenta mediates fetal exposure to maternal glucocorticoids via metabolism, yet the placenta itself responds to glucocorticoids to regulate offspring growth and development. In oviparous species, maternal glucocorticoids can be deposited into the egg yolk and are metabolized early in development. This metabolism is mediated by the extraembryonic membranes, but it is unknown if the extraembryonic membranes also respond to maternal glucocorticoids in a way comparable to the placenta. In this study, we quantified the expression of acyl-CoA thioesterase 13 (Acot13) as an initial marker of the membrane's response to corticosterone in chicken (Gallus gallus) eggs. Acot13 regulates fatty acid processing in the embryo, to potentially regulate resource availability during development. We addressed the following questions using Acot13 expression: 1) Do the extraembryonic membranes respond to yolk corticosterone early in development? 2) Is the response to corticosterone dependent on the dose of corticosterone? 3) What is the duration of the response to corticosterone? 4) Does a metabolite of corticosterone (5β-corticosterone) elicit the same response as corticosterone? We found that corticosterone significantly induces the expression of Acot13 on day four of development and that expression of Acot13 increases with the dose of corticosterone. Further, we found expression of Acot13 is significantly elevated by corticosterone on days four and six of development compared to oil treated eggs, but not on days eight and ten. Although this response is transient, it occurs during a critical period of development and could initiate a cascade of events that ultimately alter offspring phenotype. Finally, we found that 5β-corticosterone does not increase the expression of Acot13, indicating that metabolism inactivates corticosterone. Ultimately, this study provides insight into the mechanisms underlying how maternally deposited glucocorticoids can affect embryonic development.",2023,12,29

Pluronic F127-Lipoic Acid Adhesive Nanohydrogel Combining with Ce<sup>3+</sup>/Tannic Acid/Ulinastatin Nanoparticles for Promoting Wound Healing.,"Developing strong anti-inflammatory wound dressings is of great significance for protecting inflammatory cutaneous wounds and promoting wound healing. The present study develops a nanocomposite Pluronic F127 (F127)-based hydrogel dressing with injectable, tissue adhesive, and anti-inflammatory performance. Briefly, Ce<sup>3+</sup>/tannic acid/ulinastatin nanoparticles (Ce<sup>3+</sup>/TA/UTI NPs) are fabricated. Meanwhile, α-lipoic acid is bonded to the ends of F127 to prepare F127-lipoic acid (F127LA) and its nanomicelles. Due to the gradual viscosity change instead of mutation during phase transition, the mixed Ce<sup>3+</sup>/TA/UTI NPs and F127LA nanomicelles show well-performed injectability at 37 °C and can form a semisolid composite nanohydrogel that can tightly attach to the skin at 37 °C. Furthermore, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation without a photoinitiator transforms the semisolid hydrogel into a solid hydrogel with well-performed elasticity and toughness. The UV-cured composite nanohydrogel acts as a bioadhesive that can firmly adhere to tissues. Due to the limited swelling property, the hydrogel can firmly adhere to tissues in a wet environment, which can seal wounds and provide a reliable physical barrier for the wounds. Ce<sup>3+</sup>/TA/UTI NPs in the hydrogel exhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-scavenging ability and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability and significantly reduce the expression of inflammatory factors in wounds at the early stage, accelerating LPS-induced wound healing.",2023,12,29

Deciphering the Diversified Metabolic Behavior of Hydroxyalkyl Ferrocidiphenols as Anticancer Complexes.,"Ferrocidiphenols possessing appropriate substituents in the aliphatic chain have very promising anticancer properties, but a systematic approach to deciphering their diversified metabolic behavior has so far been lacking. Herein, we show that a series of novel ferrocidiphenols bearing different hydroxyalkyl substituents exhibit strong anticancer activity as revealed in a range of <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments. Moreover, they display diversified oxidative transformation profiles very distinct from those of previous complexes, shown by the use of chemical and enzymatic methods and <i>in cellulo</i> and <i>in vivo</i> metabolism studies. In view of this phenomenon, unprecedented chemo-evolutionary sequences that connect all the ferrocidiphenol-related intermediates and analogues have been established. In addition, a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study has been performed to decipher the metabolic diversification profiles of these complexes and demonstrate the delicate modulation of carbenium ions by the ferrocenyl moiety, via either α- or β-positional participation.",2023,12,29

[New Mutation of CYP24A1 in a Case of Idiopathic Infantile Hypercalcemia Diagnosed in Adulthood].,"Mutations in the 24-hydroxylase gene CYP24A1 have been recognized as causes of childhood idiopathic hypercalcemia (IIH), a rare disease (incidence <1:1,000,000 live births) characterized by increased vitamin D sensitivity, with symptomatic severe hypercalcemia. IIH was first described in Great Britain two years after the start of a program of vitamin D supplementation in milk for the prevention of rickets, manifesting in about 200 children with severe hypercalcemia, dehydration, growth failure, weight loss, muscle hypotonia, and nephrocalcinosis. The association between the epidemic occurrence of IIH and vitamin D administration was quickly attributed to intrinsic hypersensitivity to vitamin D, and the pathogenic mechanism was recognized in the inactivation of Cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1 (CYP24A1), which was identified as the molecular basis of the pathology. The phenotypic spectrum of CYP24A1 mutation can be variable, manifesting predominantly with childhood onset and severe symptomatology (severe hypercalcemia, growth retardation, lethargy, muscle hypotonia, dehydration), but also with juvenile-adult onset forms with nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and alterations in phosphocalcium homeostasis. We describe the case of a patient in whom the diagnosis of IIH was made in adulthood, presenting with finding of nephrocalcinosis in childhood, and with subsequent onset of severe hypercalcemia with hypercalciuria, hypoparathyroidism, hypervitaminosis D, and recurrent renal lithiasis. Genetic investigation revealed the presence in homozygosity of the c_428_430delAAG_p.Glu143del variant in the CYP24A1 gene with autosomal recessive transmission, a mutation not reported in the literature.",2023,12,22
Review and Practical Excursus of the Propensity Score: Low Protein Diet Compared to Mediterranean Diet in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Although Randomized clinical trials (RCT) represent the gold standard to compare two or more treatments, the impact of observational studies cannot be ignored. Obviously, these latter are performed on unbalanced sample, and differences among the compared groups could be detected. These differences could have an impact on the estimated association between our allocation and our outcome. To avoid it, some methods should be applied in the analysis of observational cohort. Propensity score (PS) can be considered as a value which sums up and balances the known variables. It aims to adjust or balance the probability of receiving a specific allocation group, and could be used to match, stratify, weight, and perform a covariate adjustment. PS is calculated with a logistic regression, using allocation groups as the outcome. Thanks to PS, we compute the probability of being allocated to one group and we can match patients obtaining two balanced groups. It avoids computing analysis in unbalanced groups. We compared low protein diet (LPD) and the Mediterranean diet in CKD patients and analysed them using the PS methods. Nutritional therapy is fundamental for the prevention, progression and treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and its complications. An individualized, stepwise approach is essential to guarantee high adherence to nutritional patterns and to reach therapeutic goals. The best dietary regimen is still a matter of discussion. In our example, unbalanced analysis showed a significant renal function preservation in LPD, but this correlation was denied after the PS analysis. In conclusion, although unmatched analysis showed differences between the two diets, after propensity analysis no differences were detected. If RCT cannot be performed, balancing the PS score allows to balance the sample and avoids biased results.",2023,12,22

Obese Male Mice Exposed to Early Life Stress Display Sympathetic Activation and Hypertension Independent of Circulating Angiotensin II.,"We have previously reported that male mice exposed to maternal separation and early weaning (MSEW), a model of early life stress, show sympathetic activation and increased blood pressure in response to a chronic high-fat diet. The goal of this study was to investigate the contribution of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to the mechanism by which MSEW increases blood pressure and vasomotor sympathetic tone in obese male mice.",2023,12,29
The effect of two facets of physicians' environmental stress on patients' compliance with COVID-19 guidelines: moderating roles of two types of ego network.,"Drawing upon the Conservation of Resources Theory, this study seeks to examine the association between two dimensions of environmental stress experienced by physicians and patients' adherence to COVID-19 guidelines, within the context of a social network framework. A third-wave longitudinal study was employed to gather 439 valid data points in China. Social network analysis and structural equation model were used to test the conceptual model. The results reveal the pivotal role of physicians' environmental stress related to their work and family contexts in influencing patients' adherence to COVID-19 guidelines through the mediation of physicians' information sharing. The ego networks of physicians, encompassing both advice-seeking and friendship ties, were observed to negatively moderate the relationship between stress and resource depletion. Broadly, our study shows the importance of understanding physicians' stress caused by the working and family environments, as these factorsnot only impact the psychological well-being of physicians but also significantly affect patients' compliance with COVID-19 guidelines. In addition, the work offers a framework for understanding the impact of the ego advice-seeking network and the ego friend network.",2023,12,29
Spillover effects of childhood obesity prevention interventions: A systematic review.,"Childhood obesity prevention initiatives are complex interventions that aim to improve children's obesity-related behaviors and provide health promoting environments. These interventions often impact individuals, communities, and outcomes not primarily targeted by the intervention or policy. To accurately capture the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of childhood obesity prevention interventions, an understanding of the broader impacts (or spillover effects) is required. This systematic review aims to assess the spillover effects of childhood obesity prevention interventions.",2023,12,29
Testing the social motivation theory of autism: the role of co-occurring anxiety.,"The Social Motivation Theory proposes that social reward processing differences underlie autism. However, low social motivation has also been linked to higher anxiety. Given the co-occurrence between autism and anxiety, it is possible that anxiety drives the association between social motivation and autistic characteristics. This study tests the mechanisms underlying the association between social motivation and autistic traits.",2023,12,29
Prevalence and Prognostic Value of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Patients Hospitalized With Decompensated Chronic Heart Failure.,"Aim    To study the incidence and effect of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) on clinical outcomes in patients with decompensated chronic heart failure (DCHF).Material and methods    The study included 338 patients with NYHA functional class III-IV DCHF (51.2% men, mean age 72.8±11.7 years), arterial hypertension (AH) in 90%, myocardial infarction in 37%, atrial fibrillation in 64%, chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 42%, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 35%, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40% in 27%. NAFLD was diagnosed based on the 2021 Clinical Guidelines of the Russian Scientific Medical Society of Therapists and the Scientific Society of Gastroenterologists of Russia. The stage of liver steatosis was determined using transient elastometry with assessment of the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) of ultrasound (S, dB/m) using a FibroScan device. Threshold CAP values &lt;294 dB/m corresponded to the degree of steatosis: S0; S1, 295-309 dB/m; S2, 310-330 dB/m; S3, ≥331 dB/m.Results    NAFLD was diagnosed in 28.9% of patients. The patients were divided into two groups: group 1 included patients with CHF and NAFLD (n=98 (28.9%), 50.0% men) and group 2 included patients with CHF without NAFLD (n=240 (71.0 %), 51.6% men). A multivariate regression analysis showed that independent predictors of NAFLD were systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg (odds ratio (OR), 3.700; p &lt;0.001), history of T2DM (OR, 2.807; p &lt;0.005), and waist circumference &gt;111 cm (OR, 2.530; p &lt;0.012). Patients with CAP ≥331 dB/m (S3) had a worse prognosis during the 2-year follow-up for the composite adverse outcome (all-cause mortality + readmission) (Kaplan-Meier curves - Log-Rank p=0.035).Conclusions    NAFLD was detected in almost one-third of patients hospitalized for DCHF. AH, T2DM, and abdominal obesity were associated with a high risk of NAFLD. However, only severe steatosis (S3) was an independent predictor of adverse clinical outcomes during a 2-year period after adjustment for known risk factors.",2023,12,27
The Clinical Evolution of Diffuse Myocardial Fibrosis in Patients With Arterial Hypertension and Heart Failure With Mildly Reduced Ejection Fraction Treated by Olmesartan or Sacubitril / Valsartan.,"Aim      A 12-month evaluation of the potentialities of the angiotensin II receptor inhibitor olmesartan (Olme) and the angiotensin receptor and neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril/valsartan in patients with arterial hypertension (AH) and dyslipidemia in the dynamics of the following indicators of chronic heart failure (CHF): N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), LV global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) in diffuse myocardial fibrosis (MF) previously diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Material and methods  Olmesartan medoxomil (n=56) and sacubitril/valsartan (n=63) were used for 12 months in patients with hypertension, dyslipidemia and NYHA functional class II-III CHF with mid-range LVEF (CHFmrEF). MF was diagnosed by the following MRI criteria: late gadolinium enhancement and an increased proportion of extracellular matrix (33% or more). The frequency of persisting late gadolinium enhancement and the increased proportion of extracellular matrix (33% or more) was evaluated at 12 months; changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), NT-proBNP, and LV GLS were evaluated after 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up.Results Baseline parameters did not differ between groups. The late gadolinium enhancement and increased proportion of extracellular matrix were present at baseline in all patients of both groups (100%; p=1.0). Already at 3 months, statistically significant decreases in SBP and DBP were observed in both groups. In addition, the LV GLS monitoring showed LV GLS significantly increased in both groups after 3 months and continued changing after 6 and 12 months. The NT-proBNP concentration significantly decreased in both groups already after 3 months and continued to decrease after 6 and 12 months. At 6 and 12 months, sacubitril/valsartan was superior to olmesartan in reducing SBP and NT-proBNP and in restoring LV GLS. At 12 months, the incidence of persisting, abnormal late gadolinium enhancement and increased proportion of extracellular matrix was significantly less in the ARNI group.Conclusion      Olmesartan was demonstrated effective in the multi-modality therapy of CHFmrEF and MF in patients with AH and dyslipidemia. ARNI was superior to olmesartan in this regard, but further research of this issue is required.",2023,12,26
"Stress, Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms are Predictors of Worse Outcomes in Outpatients With Arterial Hypertension and Coronary Heart Disease: Results of 1.5 Years Follow-up From the COMETA Multicenter Study.","Aim      To study associations between the risk of severe adverse cardiovascular outcomes (SACVO) and all-cause death with psychosocial risk factors (PS RFs), such as stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, low level of education, low income, social isolation, and type D personality, in patients with arterial hypertension (AH) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) managed in primary health care institutions in a multi-year prospective study.Material and methods  PS RFs were assessed in patients with AH or IHD, who participated in a multi-year prospective COMETA study, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), DS-14 questionnaire, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) for assessment of stress level. Associations of PS FRs with SACVO and all-cause death after a 1.5-year follow-up were analyzed using multivariate Cox regression models.Results At 1.5 years after patients were included in the study, it was possible to obtain data for 2,538 patients (age at baseline, 66.6 ± 7.8 years, 28.1% men), 106 of whom died during that period. The incidence of SACVO was 40.0 per 1000 person-years. According to the results of multivariate regression analysis, a very high level of anxiety symptoms (HADS-A≥14) was significantly associated with SACVO (odds ratio (OR), 1.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-3.15; p=0. 02). The composite endpoint that included all-cause death and/or SACVO was significantly associated with a high (VAS score ≥8) stress level (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.00-2.33; p=0.04) and a very high (HADS-D≥14) level of depressive symptoms (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.22-3.62; p=0.02). A low level of education adjusted for gender and age increased the likelihood of SACVO by 1.7 (95% CI, 1.19-2.43) times. No significant associations were found between the analyzed outcomes and type D personality or with social isolation.Conclusion      In patients with AH or IHD, the presence of high-grade stress and severe depressive symptoms increased the likelihoods of all-cause death and SACVO while a low level of education and severe anxiety symptoms were associated with SACVO. The study results showed that PS RFs for cardiovascular diseases keep the PS RF prognostic significance in the conditions of modern treatment of AH and IHD. Due to the negative impact on the prognosis, PS RFs should be taken into account when taking measures for secondary prevention of AH and IHD.",2023,12,26
The Attractiveness of Average Speech Rhythms: Revisiting the Average Effect From a Crosslinguistic Perspective.,"The current study investigates the average effect: the tendency for humans to appreciate an averaged (face, bird, wristwatch, car, and so on) over an individual instance. The effect holds across cultures, despite varying conceptualizations of attractiveness. While much research has been conducted on the average effect in visual perception, much less is known about the extent to which this effect applies to language and speech. This study investigates the attractiveness of average speech rhythms in Dutch and Mandarin Chinese, two typologically different languages. This was tested in a series of perception experiments in either language in which native listeners chose the most attractive one from a pair of acoustically manipulated rhythms. For each language, two experiments were carried out to control for the potential influence of the acoustic manipulation on the average effect. The results confirm the average effect in both languages, and they do not exclude individual variation in the listeners' perception of attractiveness. The outcomes provide a new crosslinguistic perspective and give rise to alternative explanations to the average effect.",2023,12,29
Gestural Timing Patterns of Nasality in Highly Proficient Spanish Learners of English: Aerodynamic Evidence.,"Segment-to-segment timing overlap between Vowel-Nasal gestures in /VN/ sequences varies cross-linguistically. However, how bilinguals may adjust those timing gestures is still unanswered. Regarding timing strategies in a second language (L2), research finds that native (L1) strategies can be partially transferred to the L2, and that higher L2 proficiency promotes a more successful phonetic performance. My goal is to answer whether bilingual speakers can adjust their L1 coarticulatory settings in their L2 and to observe whether their L2 accentedness plays a role in ultimate attainment. Ten native speakers of Spanish (L1Sp) who were highly proficient L2 English speakers participated in Spanish and English read-aloud tasks. A control group of 16 L1 English speakers undertook the English experiment. Aerodynamic data were collected using pressure transducers. Each participant produced tokens with nasalized vowels in CVN# words and oral vowels in CV(CV) words. Four linguistically trained judges (two per target language) evaluated a set of pseudo-randomized sentences produced by the participants containing words with nasalized vowels and rated the speech on a 1 (heavily accented) to 9 (native-like) Likert-type scale. Measurements for onset and degree of overall nasality were obtained. Results indicate the L1Sp group can accommodate gestural timing strategies cross-linguistically as they exhibit an earlier nasality onset and increment nasality proportion in L2 English in a native-like manner. In addition, a positive correlation between greater vowel nasality degree and native-like accentedness in the L2 was found, suggesting L2 timing settings might be specified in higher spoken proficiency levels.",2023,12,29

Frontline therapy with bendamustine rituximab (BR) and rituximab cyclophosphamide vincristine prednisone (RCVP) confers similar long-term outcomes in patients with treatment naïve Waldenström macroglobulinemia in a real-world setting: a population-based analysis.,"We report on outcomes of 111 patients with treatment naïve Waldenström macroglobulinemia (TN WM) treated with frontline bendamustine-rituximab (BR) (<i>n</i> = 57) or rituximab-cyclophosphamide-vincristine-prednisone (RCVP) (<i>n</i> = 54). Median follow-up was 60.7 months (range 1.9-231.6). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 60.5 months (95% CI 47.6-73.4) for BR and 79.0 months (95% CI 31.3-126.8) for RCVP (<i>p</i> = .96). Median overall survival (OS) was not reached for BR and 153.4 months (95% CI 114.5-192.4) for RCVP (<i>p</i> = .37). While overall and major response rates did not differ between treatment groups, BR had numerically higher rate of very good partial response or better response (51% vs. 37%, <i>p</i> = .30) and complete response (26% vs. 13%, <i>p</i> = .13). RCVP confers comparable outcomes to BR in a real-world population of TN WM patients and remains an effective regimen, particularly when tolerance or frailty is an issue, or in resource-limited settings.",2023,12,29
Electronic Structure Effect of PtCo Alloy with Adjustable Compositions for Efficient Methanol Electrooxidation.,"Various efficient strategies have been developed to overcome the anodic electrocatalyst issue of methanol-based fuel cells owing to their complicated methanol electrooxidation mechanism. In this work, PtCo nanoparticles with adjustable compositions supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Pt<sub>1</sub>Co<sub><i>x</i></sub>/MWCNTs) through the adsorbing-coating-annealing-etching route were synthesized. Compared with the Pt/C catalyst, Pt<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>3</sub>/MWCNTs exhibit better electrocatalytic MOR activity in both activity and durability. Notably, the electrochemical mass and specific activity of the as-prepared catalyst are 1.04 mA μg<sup>-1</sup><sub>Pt</sub> and 2.18 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, which are higher than those of the Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the as-prepared sample revealed lower onset potential during the CO stripping test. Furthermore, the Pt<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>3</sub>/MWCNTs possess a lower current density decrease rate in chronoamperometry and cyclic durability tests. The enhancement of activity and stability of Pt<sub>1</sub>Co<sub>3</sub>/MWCNTs could be ascribed to their ordered morphological structure, the electronic interaction between MWCNTs and PtCo nanoparticles, and the suitable electronic structure effect between Pt/Co ratios. The concept of the catalyst design in this study offers a different guideline for constructing the novel methanol electrooxidation catalyst, which will accelerate the widespread fuel cell practical application.",2023,12,29
Resveratrol protects mesangial cells under high glucose by regulating the miR-1231/IGF1/ERK pathway.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the complications of diabetes mellitus and the main cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which is a serious threat to human health. In DN, mesangial cells (MCs) are a critical target cell that perform a variety of key functions, and abnormal proliferation of MCs is a common and prominent pathological change in DN. In recent years, the investigation of Chinese medicine interventions for DN has increased significantly in recent years due to the many potential adverse effects and controversies associated with the treatment of DN with Western medicines. In this study, we evaluated the protective effect of resveratrol (RES), an active ingredient known as a natural antioxidant, on HMCs under high glucose and explored its possible mechanism of action. We found that RES inhibited the proliferation of human mesangial cell (HMC) under high glucose and blocked cell cycle progression. In the high glucose environment, RES upregulated miR-1231, reduced IGF1 expression, inhibited the activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway and reduced levels of the inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-6. In addition, we found that miR-1231 mimics were synergistically inhibited with RES, whereas miR-1231 inhibitor attenuated the protective effect of RES on HMCs. Thus, our results suggest that the protective effect of RES on HMCs under high glucose is achieved, at least in part, through modulation of the miR-1231/IGF1/ERK pathway. The discovery of this potential mechanism may provide a new molecular therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of DN, and may also bring new ideas for the clinical research in DN.",2023,12,29
Collaborative Learning for Annotation-Efficient Volumetric MR Image Segmentation.,"Deep learning has presented great potential in accurate MR image segmentation when enough labeled data are provided for network optimization.

Machine learning (ML) techniques as effective methods for evaluating hair and skin assessments: A systematic review.,"Machine Learning (ML) techniques provide the ability to effectively evaluate and analyze human skin and hair assessments. The aim of this study is to systematically review the effectiveness of applying Machine Learning (ML) methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in order to evaluate hair and skin assessments. PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Science Direct were searched in order to retrieve research publications between 1 January 2010 and 31 March 2020 using appropriate keywords such as ""hair and skin analysis."" Following accurate screening, 20 peer-reviewed publications were selected for inclusion in this systematic review. The analysis demonstrated that prevalent Machine Learning (ML) methods comprised of Support Vector Machine (SVM), <i>k</i>-nearest Neighbor, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). ANN's were observed to yield the highest accuracy of 95% followed by SVM generating 90%. These techniques were most commonly applied for drafting framework assessments such as that of Melanoma. Values of parameters such as Sensitivity, Specificity, and Area under the Curve (AUC) were extracted from the studies and with the help of comparisons, relevant inferences were also made. ANN's were observed to yield the highest sensitivity of 82.30% as well as a 96.90% specificity. Hence, with this systematic review, a summarization of the studies was drafted that encapsulated how Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been employed for the analysis and evaluation of hair and skin assessments.",2023,12,29
Mechanical properties and tissue damage caused by staples in gastrointestinal anastomosis.,"Gastrointestinal surgery using a stapler is usually associated with tissue damage, anastomosis leakage, bleeding, and other complications, which is one of the effective methods for treating digestive tract cancer. The cutting properties of staples and the tissue damage occurring in the process of stapling porcine esophageal and gastric tissues have been evaluated and a new type of stapler has been designed. Since different structural and mechanical properties esophageal and gastric tissues layers, the puncturing force exhibits a fluctuating trend. Compressive stress caused by the bending of the staple legs can lead to the destruction of the vascular network inside the tissue, tissue deforms and tears. Finally, a staple with an internal incision arc (IIA) tip is designed, which meeting the performance requirements.",2023,12,29
Long-term root electrotropism reveals habituation and hysteresis.,"Plant roots sense many physical and chemical cues in soil, such as gravity, humidity, light, and chemical gradients, and respond by redirecting their growth towards or away from the source of the stimulus. This process is called tropism. While gravitropism is the tendency to follow the gravitational field downwards, electrotropism is the alignment of growth with external electric fields and the induced ionic currents. Although root tropisms are at the core of their ability to explore large volumes of soil in search of water and nutrients, the molecular and physical mechanisms underlying most of them remain poorly understood. We have previously provided a quantitative characterization of root electrotropism in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) primary roots exposed for 5 hours to weak electric fields, showing that auxin asymmetric distribution is not necessary for root electrotropism but that cytokinin biosynthesis is. Here, we extend that study showing that long-term electrotropism is characterized by a complex behavior. We describe overshoot and habituation as key traits of long-term root electrotropism in Arabidopsis and provide quantitative data about the role of past exposures in the response to electric fields (hysteresis). On the molecular side, we show that cytokinin, although necessary for root electrotropism, is not asymmetrically distributed during the bending. Overall, the data presented here represent a step forward towards a better understanding of the complexity of root behavior and provide a quantitative platform for future studies on the molecular mechanisms of electrotropism.",2023,12,29
A father nevertheless: Self-confident but resigned fathers with children in foster care.,"This qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of nine fathers with neurodevelopmental disabilities with children in foster care, including their fathering role, visits and formal and informal support. Systematic text condensation was the analysis method used. The respondents' experience of fatherhood revealed two categories: I accept my situation and I am frustrated. Though self-confident, the fathers expressed ambivalence between acceptance and frustration with their role. The study shows that more should be done to provide adapted support for these vulnerable fathers with children in foster care, although they seldom demand such support. Social workers and professionals from the rehabilitation team within the healthcare service should be aware of gendered settings, specifically norms of masculinity. Increased efforts from the social workers may reduce the risks of detachment in parenthood because engaged and informed fathers are in the children's best interests.",2023,12,29

Walking with giants: The challenges of variant impact assessment in the giant sarcomeric protein titin.,"Titin, the so-called ""third filament"" of the sarcomere, represents a difficult challenge for the determination of damaging genetic variants. A single titin molecule extends across half the length of a sarcomere in striated muscle, fulfilling a variety of vital structural and signaling roles, and has been linked to an equally varied range of myopathies, resulting in a significant burden on individuals and healthcare systems alike. While the consequences of truncating variants of titin are well-documented, the ramifications of the missense variants prevalent in the general population are less so. We here present a compendium of titin missense variants-those that result in a single amino-acid substitution in coding regions-reported to be pathogenic and discuss these in light of the nature of titin and the variant position within the sarcomere and their domain, the structural, pathological, and biophysical characteristics that define them, and the methods used for characterization. Finally, we discuss the current knowledge and integration of the multiple fields that have contributed to our understanding of titin-related pathology and offer suggestions as to how these concurrent methodologies may aid the further development in our understanding of titin and hopefully extend to other, less well-studied giant proteins.

Probing the Protein-Excipient Interaction in the Orally Delivered Protein by Solid-State Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry and Molecular Dynamics.,"The oral administration of protein therapeutics in solid dosage form is gaining popularity due to its benefits, such as improved medication adherence, convenience, and ease of use for patients compared to traditional parental delivery. However, formulating oral biologics presents challenges related to pH barriers, enzymatic breakdown, and poor bioavailability. Therefore, understanding the interaction between excipients and protein therapeutics in the solid state is crucial for formulation development. In this Letter, we present a case study focused on investigating the role of excipients in protein aggregation during the production of a solid dosage form of a single variable domain on a heavy chain (VHH) protein. We employed solid-state hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (ssHDX-MS) at both intact protein and peptide levels to assess differences in protein-excipient interactions between two formulations. ssHDX-MS analysis revealed that one formulation effectively prevents protein aggregation during compaction by blocking β-sheets across the VHH protein, thereby preventing β-sheet-β-sheet interactions. Spatial aggregation propensity (SAP) mapping and cosolvent simulation from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation further validated the protein-excipient interaction sites identified through ssHDX-MS. Additionally, the MD simulation demonstrated that the interaction between the VHH protein and excipients involves hydrophilic interactions and/or hydrogen bonding. This novel approach holds significant potential for understanding protein-excipient interactions in the solid state and can guide the formulation and process development of orally delivered protein dosage forms, ultimately enhancing their efficacy and stability.",2023,12,28
Influence of Sensory Re-training on Cortical Reorganization in Peripheral Neuropathy: A Systematic Review.,"This study systematically reviewed the literature about sensory re-training effect in comparison to other rehabilitative techniques on cortical reorganization in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain. After performing an electronic search, risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies-of Interventions for non-randomized studies of intervention. The strength of conclusion was determined using the evidence-based guideline development approach. Limited evidence indicates a higher increase in cortical inhibition and a higher reduction in cortical activation during a motor task of the affected hemisphere after graded motor imagery compared to wait-list. Higher reductions in map volume (total excitability of the cortical representation) of the affected hemisphere after peripheral electrical stimulation (PES) were observed when compared to transcranial direct current stimulation(tDCS) or to sham treatment with limited evidence. No other differences in cortical excitability and representation of the affected and non-affected hemisphere were observed when comparing mirror therapy with sham therapy or tDCS, PES with sham therapy or tDCS, and graded motor imagery with wait-list. Graded motor imagery and PES result in higher cortical excitability reductions of the affected hemisphere compared to wait-list, tDCS and sham treatment, respectively.

In Situ Electrochemical Restructuring B-Doped Metal-Organic Frameworks as Efficient OER Electrocatalysts for Stable Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis.,"Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising as effective electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the origin of OER activity for MOF-based electrocatalysts is still unclear because of their structure reconstruction during electrocatalysis process. Here, a novel MOF (B-MOF-Zn-Co) with spherical superstructure is developed by hydrothermal treatment of zeolitic imidazolate framework-Zn, Co (ZIF-Zn-Co) using boric acid. The resultant B-MOF-Zn-Co shows high OER activity with a low overpotential of 362 mV at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> . Remarkably, B-MOF-Zn-Co displays excellent stability with only 3.6% voltage delay over 300 h at 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in alkaline electrolyte. Surprisingly, B-MOF-Zn-Co thoroughly transforms into B-doped CoOOH (B-CoOOH) during electrolysis process, which is served as actual active material for high OER electrocatalytic performance. The newly-formed B-CoOOH possesses lower energy barrier of potential-determining step (PDS) for OOH<sup>*</sup> formation compared with CoOOH, benefiting for high OER activity. More importantly, B-MOF-Zn-Co based anion exchange membrane water electrolytic cell (AEMWE) demonstrates continuously durable operation with stable current density of 200 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> over 300 h, illustrating its potential application in practice water electrolysis. This work offers an in situ electrochemical reconstruction strategy for the development of stable and effective OER electrocatalysts toward practice AEMWE.",2023,12,28

Remote Manipulation of TRPV1 Signaling by Near-Infrared Light-Triggered Nitric Oxide Nanogenerators for Specific Cancer Therapy.,"Specific activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid member 1 (TRPV1) channels provides a new avenue for cancer treatment by inducing excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. However, controllable manipulation of TRPV1 signaling for clinical application has remained elusive due to the challenge in finding a mild and effective method of exerting external stimulus without adverse side effects in living systems. Herein, a TRPV1-targeting near-infrared (NIR) triggered nitric oxide (NO)-releasing nanoplatform (HCuS@PDA-TRPV1/BNN6) based on polydopamine (PDA) coated hollow copper sulfide nanoparticles (HCuS NPs) is developed for specific cancer therapy. Upon NIR irradiation, the NO donor BNN6 encapsulated in NIR-responsive nanovehicles can locally generate NO to activate TRPV1 channels and induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. This NIR controlled mode enables the nanoplatform to exert its therapeutic effects below the apoptotic threshold temperature (43°C), minimizing the photothermal damage to normal tissue. Integrating this special NO-mediated therapy with HCuS NPs mediated chemodynamic therapy, the designed nanoplatform exhibits a boosted anticancer activity with negligible systematic toxicity. Together, this study provides a promising strategy for site-specific cancer therapy by spatiotemporally controlled activation of surface ion channels, thus offering a solution to an unmet clinical need in cancer treatment.",2023,12,28
Postoperative analgesic options after spine surgery: finding the optimal treatment strategies.,"Spine surgery is one of the most common types of surgeries performed in the United States; however, managing postoperative pain following spine surgery has proven to be challenging.

Application of marginalized zero-inflated models when mediators have excess zeroes.,"Mediation analysis has become increasingly popular over the last decade as researchers are interested in assessing mechanistic pathways for intervention. Although available methods have increased, there are still limited options for mediation analysis with zero-inflated count variables where the distribution of response has a ""cluster"" of data at the zero value (i.e. distribution of number of cigarettes smoked per day, where nonsmokers cluster at zero cigarettes). The currently available methods do not obtain unbiased population average effects of mediation effects. In this paper, we propose an extension of the counterfactual approach to mediation with direct and indirect effects to scenarios where the mediator is a count variable with excess zeroes by utilizing the Marginalized Zero-Inflated Poisson Model (MZIP) for the mediator model. We derive direct and indirect effects for continuous, binary, and count outcomes, as well as adapt to allow mediator-exposure interactions. Our proposed work allows straightforward calculation of direct and indirect effects for the overall population mean values of the mediator, for scenarios in which researchers are interested in generalizing direct and indirect effects to the population. We apply this novel methodology to an application observing how alcohol consumption may explain sex differences in cholesterol and assess model performance via a simulation study comparing the proposed MZIP mediator framework to existing methods for marginal mediator effects.",2023,12,28
Optimization-enabled deep learning model for disease detection in IoT platform.,"Nowadays, Internet of things (IoT) and IoT platforms are extensively utilized in several healthcare applications. The IoT devices produce a huge amount of data in healthcare field that can be inspected on an IoT platform. In this paper, a novel algorithm, named artificial flora optimization-based chameleon swarm algorithm (AFO-based CSA), is developed for optimal path finding. Here, data are collected by the sensors and transmitted to the base station (BS) using the proposed AFO-based CSA, which is derived by integrating artificial flora optimization (AFO) in chameleon swarm algorithm (CSA). This integration refers to the AFO-based CSA model enhancing the strengths and features of both AFO and CSA for optimal routing of medical data in IoT. Moreover, the proposed AFO-based CSA algorithm considers factors such as energy, delay, and distance for the effectual routing of data. At BS, prediction is conducted, followed by stages, like pre-processing, feature dimension reduction, adopting Pearson's correlation, and disease detection, done by recurrent neural network, which is trained by the proposed AFO-based CSA. Experimental result exhibited that the performance of the proposed AFO-based CSA is superior to competitive approaches based on the energy consumption (0.538 J), accuracy (0.950), sensitivity (0.965), and specificity (0.937).",2023,12,28
Golden eagle based improved Att-BiLSTM model for big data classification with hybrid feature extraction and feature selection techniques.,"The remarkable development in technology has led to the increase of massive big data. Machine learning processes provide a way for investigators to examine and particularly classify big data. Besides, several machine learning models rely on powerful feature extraction and feature selection techniques for their success. In this paper, a big data classification approach is developed using an optimized deep learning classifier integrated with hybrid feature extraction and feature selection approaches. The proposed technique uses local linear embedding-based kernel principal component analysis and perturbation theory, respectively, to extract more representative data and select the appropriate features from the big data environment. In addition, the feature selection task is fine-tuned by using perturbation theory through heuristic search based on their output accuracy. This feature selection heuristic search method is analysed with five recent heuristic optimization algorithms for deciding the final feature subset. Finally, the data are categorized through an attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory classifier that is optimized with a golden eagle-inspired algorithm. The performance of the proposed model is experimentally verified on publicly accessible datasets. From the experimental outcomes, it is demonstrated that the proposed framework is capable of classifying large datasets with more than 90% accuracy.",2023,12,28
Biological Activity and Sterilization Mechanism of Marine Fungi-derived Aromatic Butenolide Asperbutenolide A Against Staphylococcus aureus.,"marine fungi represent a huge untapped resource of natural products. The bio-activity of a new asperbutenolide A from marine fungus Aspergillus terreus was not well known. In the present study, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and RNA-Sequencing were used to analyze the bio-activity and sterilization mechanism of asperbutenolide A against clinical pathogenic microbes. The results showed that the MICs of asperbutenolide A against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 4.0-8.0 μg/mL. The asperbutenolide A present poor bio-activity against with candida. The sterilization mechanism of asperbutenolide A against MRSA showed that there were 1426 differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between the groups of MRSA treated with asperbutenolide A and negative control. Gene Ontology (GO) classification analysis indicated that the DEGs were mainly involved in cellular process, metabolic process, cellular anatomical entity, binding, catalytic activity, etc. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) classification analysis showed that these DEGs were mainly enriched in amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, membrane transport, etc. Moreover, qRT-PCR showed similar trends in the expressions of argF, ureA, glmS and opuCA with the RNA-Sequencing. These results indicated that asperbutenolide A was with ideal bio-activity against with MRSA and could be as a new antibacterial agent.",2023,12,28
Vascularization of PEGylated fibrin hydrogels increases the proliferation of human iPSC-cardiomyocytes.,"Studies have long sought to develop engineered heart tissue for the surgical correction of structural heart defects, as well as other applications and vascularization of this tissue has presented a challenge. Recent studies suggest that vascular cells and a vascular network may have regenerative effects on implanted cardiomyocytes (CM) and nearby heart tissue separate from perfusion of oxygen and nutrients. The goal of this study was to test whether vascular cells or a formed vascular network in a fibrin-based hydrogel would alter the proliferation of human iPSC-derived CM. First, vascular network formation in a slowly degrading PEGylated fibrin hydrogel was optimized by altering the cell ratio of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to human dermal fibroblasts, the inclusion of growth factors, and the total cell concentration. An endothelial to fibroblast ratio of 5:1 and a total cell concentration of 1.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL without additional growth factors generated robust vascular networks while minimizing the number of cells required. Using this optimized system, human iPSC-derived CM were cultured on hydrogels without vascular cells, hydrogels with unorganized encapsulated vascular cells, or hydrogels with encapsulated vascular cells organized into networks for 7 days. CM proliferation and gene expression were assayed following 7 days of culture on the hydrogels. The presence of vascular cells in the hydrogel, whether unorganized or in vascular networks, significantly increased CM proliferation compared to an acellular hydrogel. Hydrogels with unorganized vascular cells resulted in lower CM maturity evidenced by decreased expression of cardiac troponin t (TNNT2), myosin light chain 7, and phospholamban compared to hydrogels without vascular cells and hydrogels with vascular networks. Altogether, this study details a robust method of forming rudimentary vascular networks in a fibrin-based hydrogel and shows that a hydrogel containing endothelial cells and fibroblasts can induce proliferation in adjacent CM, and these cells do not hinder CM gene expression when organized into a vascular network.",2023,12,28
Piezocatalysis for Chemical-Mechanical Polishing of SiC: Dual Roles of t-BaTiO<sub>3</sub> as a Piezocatalyst and an Abrasive.,"Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) offers a promising pathway to smooth third-generation semiconductors. However, it is still a challenge to reduce the use of additional oxidants or/and energy in current CMP processes. Here, a new and green atomically smoothing method: Piezocatalytic-CMP (Piezo-CMP) is reported. Investigation shows that the Piezo-CMP based on tetragonal BaTiO<sub>3</sub> (t-BT) can polish the rough surface of a reaction sintering SiC (RS-SiC) to the ultra-smooth surface with an average surface roughness (Ra) of 0.45 nm and the rough surface of a single-crystal 4H-SiC to the atomic planarization Si and C surfaces with Ra of 0.120 and 0.157 nm, respectively. In these processes, t-BT plays a dual role of piezocatalyst and abrasive. That is, it piezo-catalytically generates in-situ active oxygen species to selectively oxidize protruding sites of SiC surface, yielding soft SiO<sub>2</sub> , and subsequently, it acts as a usual abrasive to mechanically remove these SiO<sub>2</sub> . This mechanism is further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation and molecular simulation. In this process, piezocatalytic oxidation is driven only by the original pressure and friction force of a conventional polishing process, thus, the piezo-CMP process do not require any additional oxidant and energy, being a green and effective polishing method.",2023,12,28

Infiltrative pattern of invasion is independently associated with shorter survival and desmoplastic stroma markers FAP and THBS2 in mucinous ovarian carcinoma.,"Mucinous ovarian carcinoma (MOC) is a rare ovarian cancer histotype with generally good prognosis when diagnosed at an early stage. However, MOC with the infiltrative pattern of invasion has a worse prognosis, although to date studies have not been large enough to control for covariables. Data on reproducibility of classifying the invasion pattern are limited, as are molecular correlates for infiltrative invasion. We hypothesized that the invasion pattern would be associated with an aberrant tumour microenvironment.",2023,12,28
Locus Coeruleus-Dorsolateral Septum Projections Modulate Depression-Like Behaviors via BDNF But Not Norepinephrine.,"Locus coeruleus (LC) dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of depression; however, the neural circuits and specific molecular mechanisms responsible for this dysfunction remain unclear. Here, it is shown that activation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons in the LC alleviates depression-like behaviors in susceptible mice. The dorsolateral septum (dLS) is the most physiologically relevant output from the LC under stress. Stimulation of the LC<sup>TH</sup> -dLS<sup>SST</sup> innervation with optogenetic and chemogenetic tools bidirectionally can regulate depression-like behaviors in both male and female mice. Mechanistically, it is found that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but not norepinephrine, is required for the circuit to produce antidepressant-like effects. Genetic overexpression of BDNF in the circuit or supplementation with BDNF protein in the dLS is sufficient to produce antidepressant-like effects. Furthermore, viral knockdown of BDNF in this circuit abolishes the antidepressant-like effect of ketamine, but not fluoxetine. Collectively, these findings underscore the notable antidepressant-like role of the LC<sup>TH</sup> -dLS<sup>SST</sup> pathway in depression via BDNF-TrkB signaling.",2023,12,28
Design and Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Furan-Indole Compounds Bearing both Axial and Central Chirality.,"In the chemistry community, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of furan-based compounds bearing both axial and central chirality has proven to be a significant but challenging issue owing to the importance and difficulty in constructing such frameworks. In this work, we have realized the first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of five-five-membered furan-based compounds bearing both axial and central chirality via organocatalytic asymmetric (2+4) annulation of achiral furan-indoles with 2,3-indolyldimethanols with uncommon regioselectivity. By this strategy, furan-indole compounds bearing both axial and central chirality were synthesized in high yields with excellent regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivities. Moreover, theoretical calculations were conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of the reaction pathway, activation mode, and the origin of the selectivity.",2023,12,28

Pyrroloquinoline quinone supplementation attenuates inflammatory liver injury by STAT3/TGF-β1 pathway in weaned piglets challenged with lipopolysaccharide.,"This study is aimed to evaluate the effect and underling mechanism of dietary supplementation with pyrroloquinoline quinone disodium (PQQ) on improving inflammatory liver injury in piglets challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A total of 72 crossbred barrows were allotted into 4 groups as following: the CTRL group (basal diet + saline injection); the PQQ group (3 mg/kg PQQ diet + saline injection); the CTRL + LPS group (basal diet + LPS injection); and the PQQ + LPS group (3 mg/kg PQQ diet + LPS injection). On d 7, 11 and 14, piglets were challenged with LPS or saline. Blood was sampled at 4 hours after the last LPS injection (d 14), then the piglets were slaughtered and liver tissue were harvested.The results showed that the hepatic morphology was improved in the PQQ + LPS group compared with the CTRL + LPS group. PQQ supplementation decreased level of serum inflammatory factors, AST, ALT, and increased HDL-C concentration in piglets challenged with LPS; piglets in PQQ + LPS group had lower liver mRNA level of inflammatory factors and protein level of α-SMA than in CTRL + LPS group; Besides, mRNA expression of STAT3/TGF-β1 pathway and protein level of p-STAT3(Tyr 705) were decreased, and mRNA level of <i>PPARα</i> and protein expression of p-AMPK in liver were increased in PQQ + LPS group compared to CTRL + LPS group (<i>P</i> < 0.05).

Preventive and therapeutic effects of low-dose whole-body irradiation on collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis in mice.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by progressive joint inflammation, resulting in cartilage destruction and bone erosion. It was reported that low-dose radiation modulates immune disease. Here, we investigated whether low-dose whole-body irradiation has preventive and therapeutic effects in collagen-induced RA (CIA) mouse models. Fractionated low-dose irradiation (0.05 Gy/fraction, total doses of 0.1, 0.5 or 0.8 Gy) was administered either concurrently with CIA induction by Type II collagen immunization (preventive) or after CIA development (therapeutic). The severity of CIA was monitored using two clinical parameters, paw swelling and redness. We also measured total Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and inflammatory cytokines (interleukine (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)) in the serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and we evaluated histological changes in the ankle joints by immunohistochemistry and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Low-dose irradiation reduced CIA clinical scores by up to 41% in the preventive model and by 28% in the therapeutic model, while irradiation in the preventive model reduced the typical CIA incidence rate from 82 to 56%. In addition, low-dose irradiation in the preventive model decreased total IgG by up to 23% and decreased IL-1β and TNF-α by 69 and 67%, and in the therapeutic model, decreased total IgG by up to 35% and decreased IL-1β and IL-6 by 59 and 42% with statistical significance (P < 0.01, 0.05 and 0.001). Our findings demonstrate that low-dose radiation has preventive and therapeutic anti-inflammatory effects against CIA by controlling the immune response, suggesting that low-dose radiation may represent an alternative therapy for RA, a chronic degenerative immune disease.",2023,12,28

Window of detection of cocaine related alkaloids in oral fluid collected with the FloqSwab™ after coca tea consumption.,"Coca tea is a popular drink in some countries of South America where it is presented as a safe energy preparation, based on a limited total content of cocaine of about 3 to 5 mg. Tea bags can be bought with no legal considerations in these countries both by locals and tourists but its consumption can have consequences when consumed overseas. Driving under the influence of cocaine is banned in most places in the world and can be documented by oral fluid testing. A study was implemented with coca tea bags (Coca & Muna) purchased in Peru, after a French attorney at law contacted the laboratory to assess the involvement of coca tea in the positive oral fluid results of a driver. Ten healthy volunteers consumed 250 mL of coca tea containing 4.5 mg of cocaine. No volunteer reported any change in behavioral effects after consumption of the coca tea. Oral fluid was collected with a swab (FloqSwab™, Copan) over 8 hours to follow the elimination of cocaine and its major metabolites (benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methylester). This is the procedure used by the French police. All samples were analyzed by UHPLC-MS-MS after Quantisal™ buffer desorption. As the device does not allow measurement of the amount of collected fluid, the results are qualitative. This is in accordance with the French law that requires a yes or no response about the presence of cocaine, with a minimum required performance level of 10 ng/ml of cocaine or benzoylecgonine. Parent cocaine was identified for 30 to 120 min. Benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methylester were identified between 1 and 8 hours, with a large inter-individual variation. Although it is generally accepted that a 4 to 5 mg cocaine dose has no significant pharmacological effect, the consumption of coca tea can lead to the suspension of a person's driving license due to a positive oral fluid test.",2023,12,29

Love Matters: The Effect of Mating Motive on Female Food Choice.,"The prevalence of obesity has been increasing globally in recent decades. Behind the phenomenon, high-fat food consumption has been conceived as an important driver. In the current study, we explored whether mating motive caused an effect on female food choice as well as the psychological mechanism underlying it. In Study 1, we recruited 64 participants from a university and asked them to complete a mating prime, after which they would finish a food choice task in which food with different flavors were shown. In Study 2, we replicated Study 1 with a different mating priming method and examined the mediating role of body shaping desire on the relation between mating motive and female food choice. Results showed that: (1) The salience of mating motive decreased female's high-fat food choice but increased male's high-fat food choice; (2) the effect of mating motive in females was robust and more salient for sweet food rather than salty food; and (3) the body shaping desire partially mediated the effect of mating motive on female food choice.",2023,12,28

Proximity Estimation and Quantification of Ionizing Radiation-induced DNA Lesions in Aqueous Media using Fluorescence Spectroscopy.,"Clustered DNA damage (cluster) or a multiply damaged site, which is a region with two or more lesions within one or two helical turns, has a high mutagenic potential and causes cell death. We quantified fluorophore-labeled lesions and estimated their proximity through fluorescence anisotropy measurements depending on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) among the fluorophores close to each other. pUC19 plasmid DNA (2,686 base pairs) dissolved in water or 0.2 M Tris-HCl buffer at a concentration of 10 μg/μL was irradiated by several ionizing radiations with varying linear energy transfers (LET, 0.2-1890 keV/μm). Electrophilic carbonyls (aldehydes and ketones) at abasic sites (APs) produced in DNA were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescent dyes with an O-amino functional group. Regardless of the presence or absence of the buffer, AP yields (the number of APs/base pair/Gy) tended to decrease with increasing LET, and the ratio of the AP yield (in 0.2 M Tris-HCl/in water) was less than 0.1 in the LET range of 0.2-200 keV/μm. However, in a higher LET range, the ratios were greater than 0.1. At a low dose, fluorescence anisotropy decreased with increasing LET in 0.2 M Tris-HCl, whereas, in water, this LET dependence was almost insignificant. These findings suggest that 1. the damage distribution on a DNA molecule formed by indirect effects (e.g., by hydroxyl radicals) does not depend on radiation quality and 2. greater LET radiation is more likely to produce a cluster and/or to produce a cluster with shorter distances between lesions by direct effects. This FRET-based proximity estimation of DNA lesions will contribute not only to the identification of clusters and their complexity in a whole genome, but also to the study of their repair mechanism by single-molecular level fluorescence microscopy.",2023,12,29
"Synthesis of zeolites from volcanic ash (Tajogaite, Spain) for the remediation of waters contaminated by fluoride.","In the eruptive event of Tajogaite (2021) in La Palma, Canary Islands, large quantities of volcanic ash were accumulated, affecting the local environment and urban areas. In this study, volcanic ash sampled from urban areas (catalogued as municipal waste (20 03 03) by the European Wastes Catalogue) were converted into zeolites by hydrothermal synthesis at 100 °C with previous alkaline fusion at 550 °C with distilled water. During this process, new phases of zeolite principally type X and sodalite have been identified by XRD at 2 h of incubation. These zeolites, with the course of incubation time, present competitive processes where the transformation into sodalite develops after 24 h as the predominant phase. The synthesized zeolitic material presents a high concentration as impurities in Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (13.70 wt%), Na<sub>2</sub>O (12.70 wt%), CaO (11.65 wt%), and TiO<sub>2</sub> (3.89 wt%) coming from the volcanic ash and NaOH introduced in the synthesis methodology. These impurities impart different physicochemical capabilities to the zeolitic material. The application of zeolites obtained in a preliminary fluoride adsorption experiment with volcanic leachate water rich in fluoride has been tested in a novel way. Removal efficiencies of 41.4% at acidic pH (5.77) have been obtained with 2 g L<sup>-1</sup> adsorbent zeolitic material doses. A value-added material is obtained and applied in a preliminary way to solve a problem generated by the volcanic ash itself, allowing the End of Waste status and meeting different objectives of the sustainable development goals of the UN Agenda 2030.",2023,12,29
Instantaneous CO<sub>2</sub> emission modelling for a Euro 6 start-stop vehicle based on portable emission measurement system data and artificial intelligence methods.,"One of the increasingly common methods to counteract the increased fuel consumption of vehicles is start-stop technology. This paper introduces a methodology which presents the process of measuring and creating a computational model of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions using artificial intelligence techniques for a vehicle equipped with start-stop technology. The method requires only measurement data of velocity, acceleration of vehicle, and gradient of road to predict the emission of CO<sub>2</sub>. In this paper, three methods of machine learning techniques were analyzed, while the best prediction results are shown by the gradient boosting method. For the developed models, the results were validated using the coefficient of determination, the mean squared error, and based on visual evaluation of residual and instantaneous emission plots and CO<sub>2</sub> emission maps. The developed models present a novel methodology and can be used for microscale environmental analysis.",2023,12,29
Auditing the inference processes of medical-image classifiers by leveraging generative AI and the expertise of physicians.,"The inferences of most machine-learning models powering medical artificial intelligence are difficult to interpret. Here we report a general framework for model auditing that combines insights from medical experts with a highly expressive form of explainable artificial intelligence. Specifically, we leveraged the expertise of dermatologists for the clinical task of differentiating melanomas from melanoma 'lookalikes' on the basis of dermoscopic and clinical images of the skin, and the power of generative models to render 'counterfactual' images to understand the 'reasoning' processes of five medical-image classifiers. By altering image attributes to produce analogous images that elicit a different prediction by the classifiers, and by asking physicians to identify medically meaningful features in the images, the counterfactual images revealed that the classifiers rely both on features used by human dermatologists, such as lesional pigmentation patterns, and on undesirable features, such as background skin texture and colour balance. The framework can be applied to any specialized medical domain to make the powerful inference processes of machine-learning models medically understandable.",2023,12,28
Before-and-After Photography on Social Media: The Pursuit of Impossible Beauty.,"Plastic surgeons and aesthetic medicine professionals often share ""before"" and ""after"" clinical cases on social media, but this practice can lead to unintended consequences, such as dysmorphophobia and unrealistic expectations. These before-and-after images, frequently posted on social media, tend to promote unreachable, sometimes retouched, beauty standards, downplaying the complexities of the surgical process, omitting details about postoperative care, recovery, and potential complications. This can create the illusion that perfection is easily attainable through surgery, fostering unrealistic ideals and negatively impacting viewers' self-image and self-worth. Dysmorphophobia, characterized by an excessive preoccupation with perceived flaws in one's appearance, is closely linked to social media usage, especially among Caucasian women. Plastic surgeons hold the responsibility to provide honest insights into cosmetic procedures on social media, emphasizing the healing process, potential risks, and limitations. Celebrating diversity in appearance and sharing genuine patient stories can combat idealized beauty standards and reduce the stigma surrounding cosmetic surgery. They must prioritize honesty, provide comprehensive context for their images, and promote a broader view of beauty that includes mental health and individual diversity. Their ethical responsibility extends beyond the operating room and should guide all aspects of their professional practice.Level of Evidence V This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Disordered Eating in Young Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was the most prevalent endocrine disorder among women. Weight issues were commonly observed and found to be associated with comorbidities. This study aimed to compare Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) scores and Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ) scores in patients with and without PCOS and analyze the factors associated with disordered eating. Women aged 18-25 years with and without PCOS (n = 110 for each group) were included in the study. All patients completed the EDE-Q, NEQ, Beck Anxiety, and Beck Depression inventories. Disordered eating was found more frequently in women with PCOS than in controls (25.5% vs. 2.7%, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in NEQ scores between the two groups. Anxiety and depression scores were higher in patients with PCOS than in controls (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively). PCOS diagnosis (OR: 7.4, CI: [1.63-33.7]; p = 0.010) and high BMI (OR: 1.24, CI: [1.10-1.39]; p < 0.001) were found to be independent factors for disordered eating (EDE-Q global score ≥ 4). Disordered eating was more common in young women with PCOS compared to the control group. PCOS diagnosis and having a high BMI (> 25) were found to be independent factors related to disordered eating in young women with PCOS. Young women with a high BMI or PCOS appear to be at a higher risk of disordered eating than women of the same age. Scanning this group may help clinicians in identifying women at high risk for eating disorders and preventing comorbidities associated with them.",2023,12,28
Laser ablation on vascular diseases: mechanisms and influencing factors.,"Vascular diseases, such as venous insufficiency and coronary artery diseases, have been threatening the health of people. Efficient treatment with proper postoperative care is required to relieve the pain of the patients. Traditionally, venous insufficiency is treated with ligation and stripping, an open surgery whose complication rate cannot be ignored. Coronary artery disease is often treated with balloon angioplasty during which undilatable lesions may be encountered, limiting the efficacy of this approach. With advances in laser photonics and percutaneous coronary intervention procedure, laser ablation is emerging as an alternative and adjunctive therapy for these diseases. Endovenous laser ablation has the advantages of high success rate, low complication risk, and fast postoperative recovery. Laser ablation in arteries can handle uncrossable or undilatable lesions with a low incidence of serious complications. In this review, previously published research concerning vascular diseases and their therapies are analyzed in order to provide a clear explanation of the mechanisms and merits of laser ablation. For endovenous laser ablation, the main mechanisms are steam bubbles, heat conduction, and heat pipe, and three main influencing factors are wavelength, fiber types, and laser energy density. For excimer laser coronary atherectomy, the main mechanisms are photochemical, photothermal, and photomechanical effects, and three main influencing factors are catheter, medium, and laser parameters.",2023,12,29
Experimental evidence that increased surface temperature affects bioturbation by ants.,"Ants are important bioturbators that actively produce biopores and move soil particles. They could be particularly affected by global warming as they are ectotherms. Nevertheless, they can indirectly regulate their temperature, through changes in their circadian cycles and the architecture of their nests (e.g. digging deep nests or using insulating materials). Nest architecture has been considered an expanded functional trait of ant colonies and thus sensitive to environmental changes such as increasing temperatures. This work aimed to study the nest architecture of ants as a functional trait and its effects on soil bioturbation. We hypothesized that, when exposed to increased surface temperatures, ants would increase their excavation activities, build deeper nests and alter the layout of chambers to maintain their preferred temperature and humidity, thus enhancing soil porosity. We allowed 17 young Lasius niger ant colonies to excavate nests in soil columns exposed to three surface temperatures (mild, n = 5; medium, n = 6; and high, n = 6) for 100 days. We measured the amount of soil excavated weekly and took X-ray scans of the soil column on Days 7, 14, 28, and 88 to characterize the three-dimensional structure of the nests (depth, shape, volume of chambers and tunnels). We then collected the colonies and measured their growth during the experiment, and the size and weight of workers. Ants reacted to surface temperature. Colonies exposed to medium and high temperatures excavated larger and deeper nests than those exposed to mild temperature. Nests excavated under high and medium temperatures had the same maximal depth, but chambers were located deeper in the former, which were further characterized by the refiling of some of the upper chambers. Colonies grew well in all treatments, although less under mild temperature. They produced normal-sized workers despite differences in surface temperature. Overall, these results suggest that ants exposed to higher temperatures live in deeper chambers. This study shows that surface temperature affects ant nest architecture, confirming its status as extended phenotype and highlighting its flexibility over time, which has in turn consequences on soil porosity.",2023,12,28
The effect of miR-223-3p on endothelial cells in coronary artery disease.,"Endothelial cell damage and dysfunction are crucial factors in the development and early stages of coronary artery disease (CAD) and apoptosis plays a significant role in this process. In this study, We aimed to simulate the CAD vascular microenvironment by treating endothelial cells with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) to construct an endothelial cell apoptosis model. Our findings revealed that the TNF-α model resulted in increased micro-RNA 223-3p (miR-223-3p) mRNA and Bax protein expression, decreased kruppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) and Bcl-2 protein expression, and decreased cell viability. More importantly, in the TNF-α-induced endothelial cell apoptosis model, transfection with the miR-223-3p inhibitor reversed the effects of TNF-α on Bcl-2, Bax expression. We transfected miRNA-223-3p mimics or inhibitors into endothelial cells and assessed miR-223-3p levels using RT-PCR. Cell viability was detected using CCK8. Western blot technology was used to detect the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and KLF15. In summary, this study demonstrates the role and possible mechanism of miR-223-3p in endothelial cells during CAD, suggesting that miR-223-3p may serve as a promising therapeutic target in CAD by regulating KLF15.",2023,12,28

<sup>177</sup>Lu-Labeled Bivalent Ligands of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen for Endoradiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.,"Recently, we developed a bivalent prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radioligand ([<sup>18</sup>F]AlF-Bi-PSMA), which showed higher tumor uptake and retention in PSMA-positive mouse models than the clinically used radioligands, [<sup>68</sup>Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [<sup>18</sup>F]PSMA-1007. Here, we developed two <sup>177</sup>Lu-labeled bivalent PSMA ligands with (DOTA-Alb-Bi-PSMA) or without an albumin-binding motif (DOTA-Bi-PSMA) to enhance radiotherapeutic efficacy with minimal toxicity. The results demonstrated that both <sup>177</sup>Lu-labeled bivalent radioligands showed good stability, high binding affinity, and PSMA-targeting specificity in vitro. Compared with [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, both [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-Bi-PSMA and [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-Alb-Bi-PSMA showed a higher area under the curve (AUC) of tumor accumulation and superior therapeutic efficacy. However, [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-Alb-Bi-PSMA exhibited a dose-dependent increase in acute damage to kidneys. In terms of the radionuclide therapy efficacy and side effects, [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-Bi-PSMA exhibited well-balanced action with high tumor-to-organs AUC ratios, resulting in remarkable therapeutic efficacy and negligible side effects. These promising results warrant further investigations to achieve the clinical translation of [<sup>177</sup>Lu]Lu-Bi-PSMA.",2023,12,28
Actinobacteria as Microbial Cell Factories and Biocatalysts in The Synthesis of Chiral Intermediates and Bioactive Molecules; Insights and Applications.,"Actinobacteria are one of the most intriguing bacterial phyla in terms of chemical diversity and bioactivities of their reported biomolecules and natural products, including various types of chiral molecules. Actinobacterial genera such as Detzia, Mycobacterium, and Streptomyces are among the microbial sources targeted for selective reactions such as asymmetric biocatalysis catalyzed by whole cells or enzymes induced in their cell niche. Remarkably, stereoselective reactions catalyzed by actinobacterial whole cells or their enzymes include stereoselective oxidation, stereoselective reduction, kinetic resolution, asymmetric hydrolysis, and selective transamination, among others. Species of actinobacteria function with high chemo-, regio-, and enantio-selectivity under benign conditions, which could help current industrial processing. Numerous selective enzymes were either isolated from actinobacteria or expressed from actinobacteria in other microbes and hence exploited in the production of pure organic compounds difficult to obtain chemically. In addition, different species of actinobacteria, especially Streptomyces species, function as natural producers of chiral molecules of therapeutic importance. Herein, we discuss some of the most outstanding contributions of actinobacteria to asymmetric biocatalysis, which are important in the organic and/or pharmaceutical industries. In addition, we highlight the role of actinobacteria as microbial cell factories for chiral natural products with insights into their various biological potentialities.",2023,12,28

[Severe hemoptysis in the onco-hematology patient].,"In France, even though it occurs only exceptionally in cases of hemopathy, severe hemoptysis in cancer is the leading cause of hemoptysis. Without adequate treatment, in-hospital mortality exceeds 60%, even reaching 100% at 6 months. The management of severe hemoptysis should be discussed with the oncologist. Aside from situations of threatening hemoptysis, in which bronchoscopy should be performed immediately, CT angiography is an essential means of localizing the bleeding and determining the causes and the vascular mechanisms involved. In more than 90% of cases, hemoptysis is linked to systemic bronchial or non-bronchial hypervascularization, whereas in fewer than 5%, it is associated with pulmonary arterial origin or, exceptionally, with damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier. The most severely ill patients must be treated in intensive care in centers equipped with interventional radiology, thoracic surgery and, ideally, with interventional bronchoscopy. Interventional radiology is the first-line symptomatic treatment. In over 80% of cases, bronchial arteriography with embolization allows immediate control. Emergency surgery should be avoided, as it is associated with significant mortality. Appropriate and adequate care reduces hospital mortality to 30%, enabling patients to benefit from the most recent, survival-prolonging treatments.",2023,12,27

Interleukin-33/serum stimulation-2 pathway: Regulatory mechanisms and emerging implications in immune and inflammatory diseases.,"Interleukin (IL)- 33, a nuclear factor and pleiotropic cytokine of the IL-1 family, is gaining attention owing to its important role in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This review extends our knowledge of the effects exerted by IL-33 on target cells by binding to its specific receptor serum stimulation-2 (ST2). Depending on the tissue context, IL-33 performs multiple functions encompassing host defence, immune response, initiation and amplification of inflammation, tissue repair, and homeostasis. The levels and activity of IL-33 in the body are controlled by complex IL-33-targeting regulatory pathways. The unique temporal and spatial expression patterns of IL-33 are associated with host homeostasis and the development of immune and inflammatory disorders. Therefore, understanding the origin, function, and processes of IL-33 under various conditions is crucial. This review summarises the regulatory mechanisms underlying the IL-33/ST2 signalling axis and its potential role and clinical significance in immune and inflammatory diseases, and discusses the current complex and conflicting findings related to IL-33 in host responses.",2023,12,14
Naphazoline intoxication managed with minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring.,"Naphazoline, a nonspecific alpha-adrenoceptor stimulant, is a potent vasoconstrictor used in nasal sprays, eye drops, and over-the-counter antiseptics. Naphazoline intoxication increases afterload by constricting the peripheral arteries, which can lead to complications including multiple organ failure. Although phentolamine, a nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, and nicardipine, a calcium channel blocker, are used for the treatment of naphazoline intoxication, no established administration protocols currently exist. We present the case of a 32-year-old male with depression who ingested 150 mL of an antiseptic containing 0.1% naphazoline (equivalent to 150 mg of naphazoline). Five hours after ingestion, the patient was admitted to hospital exhibiting signs of naphazoline intoxication, such as bradycardia (46 beats/min), blood pressure of 166/122 mmHg, and peripheral cyanosis. We used the FloTrac™/EV1000™ system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA), a minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring system, to monitor systemic vascular resistance. The systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) was elevated (4457 dyne.s/cm<sup>5</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>; nomal range: 1970-2390 dyne.s/cm<sup>5</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>) upon admission and initial treatment with continuous intravenous infusion of phentolamine led to SVRI normalization within 2 h. With the goal of maintaining SVRI normalization, continuous infusion with nicardipine was then started. At 10 h after treatment initiation, the nicardipine dose peaked at 9 mg/h (1.9 μg/kg/min). Treatment was discontinued 8 h later, and the patient was discharged on the fourth day without sequelae. In conclusion, the use of a minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring system to track vascular resistance can effectively guide the dosing of phentolamine or nicardipine in the treatment of naphazoline intoxication.",2023,12,24

It is therefore important to learn and compare practices around the world.",2023,12,27
Clinical and radiographic outcomes of a combined surgery approach to treat peri-implantitis.,"Peri-implant infra-bony defects are difficult to treat, and data on the management of peri-implantitis are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a combined surgical approach to manage peri-implantitis: implantoplasty with xenogeneic bone grafting and a concentrated growth factor membrane. Two independent examiners analysed the medical records and radiographs taken before surgery and at the last follow-up. Data were analysed at the implant level; some patient-level data (age, sex, smoking habit) were also considered. Linear regression analysis with generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to explore the effect of variables of interest (including marginal bone level (MBL)) on implantitis treatment success and resolution rates. The effect of the prosthesis type on postoperative clinical and radiographic parameters was also explored by GEE, with adjustment for age, sex, tooth site, location, follow-up duration, and implant length (model IV including all). Thirty patients with 72 implants were investigated. The implant survival rate was 100% over a mean observation period of 3.3 years (range 2-11 years). The treatment success rate (bone loss <0.5 mm, no bleeding on probing (BOP), no suppuration, probing depth (PD) < 5 mm) was higher in females than males (50% vs 19.0%; P = 0.008). At the last postoperative follow-up, the MBL (1.51 ± 1.07 vs 4.01 ± 1.13 mm), PD (3.61 ± 0.84 vs 6.54 ± 1.01 mm), and BOP (23.38 ± 23.18% vs 79.17 ± 15.51%) were significantly reduced when compared to pre-surgery values (all P < 0.001). Furthermore, a significantly higher PD reduction (β = -1.10 mm, 95% confidence interval -1.97 to -0.23 mm, P = 0.014) was observed for implants with a single crown than a full-arch prosthesis (GEE model IV).

CDC COVID-19 vaccination program: Healthcare provider compliance with COVID-19 vaccine requirements and recommendations.,"The COVID-19 Vaccination Provider Oversight (CVPO) program was implemented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to ensure the proper management and administration of COVID-19 vaccines by healthcare providers participating in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program. As part of the CVPO program, the 64 CDC-funded immunization program awardees conducted site visits with participating healthcare providers. We evaluated healthcare provider adherence to CVPO program requirements between May 2021 and May 2023. CVPO program site visit data was collected using a REDCap database. The proportion of site visits conducted by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) region was calculated. Chi-square statistics for healthcare provider compliance with CVPO program requirements were presented to assess variation in compliance by provider type. The proportion of healthcare providers receiving a site visit ranged from 7.9 % to 37.2 % across HHS regions. Healthcare provider compliance was high for COVID-19 vaccine preparation, administration, and error reporting categories (>90 %). Healthcare provider compliance was lowest for vaccine storage and handling and reporting requirements (79.9 % and 82.6 %, respectively). Public health providers demonstrated significantly higher overall compliance as compared to all other included healthcare provider types (p-value < 0.05). The observed high healthcare provider compliance, coupled with thorough follow-up efforts by awardees to address any non-compliance concerns, highlights the success of jurisdictions supporting healthcare providers with proper vaccine management, administration, and safety procedures. Further research can strengthen vaccine storage, handling, and administration practices for future widespread vaccination efforts.",2023,12,27

Design of Ultrapotent Genetically Encoded inhibitors of Kv4.2 for Gating Neural Plasticity.,"The Kv4.2 potassium channel plays established roles in neuronal excitability, while also being implicated in plasticity. Current means to study the roles of Kv4.2 are limited, motivating us to design a genetically encoded membrane tethered Heteropodatoxin-2 (MetaPoda). We find that MetaPoda is an ultrapotent and selective gating-modifier of Kv4.2. We narrow its site of contact with the channel to two adjacent residues within the voltage sensitive domain (VSD) and, with docking simulations, suggest that the toxin binds the VSD from within the membrane. We also show that MetaPoda does not require an external linker of the channel for its activity. In neurons (obtained from female and male rat neonates), MetaPoda specifically, and potently, inhibits all Kv4-currents, leaving all other A-type currents unaffected. Inhibition of Kv4 in hippocampal neurons does not promote excessive excitability, as is expected from a simple potassium channel blocker. We do find that MetaPoda's prolonged expression (1 week) increases expression levels of the immediate early gene cFos and prevents potentiation. These findings argue for a major role of Kv4.2 in facilitating plasticity of hippocampal neurons. Lastly, we show that our engineering strategy is suitable for the swift engineering of another potent Kv4.2-selective membrane-tethered toxin, Phrixotoxin-1 denoted MetaPhix. Together, we provide two uniquely potent genetic tools to study Kv4.2 in neuronal excitability and plasticity.<b>Significance Statement</b> Inhibition of the Kv4.2 potassium channel in neurons via two unique and potent membrane tethered toxins reveals a major role for the channel in plasticity, without increasing neural excitability.",2023,12,28

Endomyocardial fibrosis: a tragic conundrum or a mere negligence?,"Often termed as 'vanishing mystery' epidemiologically, endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) continues to be the the most common cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy in Africa and some parts of the Indian subcontinent, where it is considered a significant public health problem. On the other hand, in developed countries, it is considered a rare phenomenon. This entity is considered incurable due to lack of targeted therapies, even after 75 years since its discovery. The authors describe here a case of an Indian male, in his early 30s who presented with complaints of dyspnoea on minimal daily activities, swelling of both legs and abdominal fullness for 3 months. The clinical features were suggestive of isolated right heart failure. He was diagnosed with EMF on echocardiography and the findings were confirmed on cardiac MRI.

Reciprocal impulses of junctional origin causing trigeminy.,"Reciprocal impulses of junctional origin were seen in a patient with left isomerism who had undergone Kawashima repair in infancy. Heterotaxy syndromes are associated with disturbances in sinus node function. Junctional rhythm is hence common in this group. Junctional rhythm can conduct both anterogradely, to the ventricles, and retrogradely, back to the atrium. When it conducts retrogradely, it is termed as atrial echo, which can further conduct back to the ventricle. Our patient had a junctional rhythm with atrial echo beats that conduct to the ventricle, along with an ectopic atrial focus that does not conduct to the ventricle. This is due to variation in the RP interval [between R wave and subsequent P wave] of the echo beat and the atrial ectopic beat with respect to the preceding QRS complex. The timing of the P wave after the QRS complex determines the refractoriness of the atrioventricular node. This exhibits a trigeminal rhythm in our patient.",2023,12,28

Spatial distribution and modelling of <sup>239+240</sup>Pu in the sediments and seawater columns of the South China Sea and Indian Ocean.,"In order to investigate the <sup>239+240</sup>Pu potential influence in the ocean, and develop a new method for rapidly monitoring radioactive pollution, the <sup>239+240</sup>Pu spatial distribution in the South China Sea (SCS) and the Indian Ocean (IND) sediments is analyzed by SF-ICP-MS (ELEMENT 2). The inventory-weighted mean activities of <sup>239+240</sup>Pu were 0.413 ± 0.333 mBq/g, 0.128 ± 0.044 mBq/g, and 0.483 ± 0.606 mBq/g in the sediments of the SCS, eastern IND, and Arabian Sea, respectively. The <sup>239+240</sup>Pu activity spatial distribution in the SCS sediments was influenced by the current, the vertical distribution of Pu in seawater, and the transport of particulate matter. The <sup>239+240</sup>Pu activity spatial distribution in the IND sediments could be impacted by Antarctic Intermediate Water. The average of <sup>240</sup>Pu/<sup>239</sup>Pu atomic ratios were 0.258 ± 0.034, 0.219 ± 0.031, and 0.212 ± 0.028 in the sediments of the SCS, eastern IND, and Arabian Sea, respectively. The <sup>240</sup>Pu/<sup>239</sup>Pu atomic ratios in the SCS and IND indicate that Pu from the Pacific Proving Ground (PPG) is transported to the IND via the SCS internal current and transverse ocean currents within Indonesia. In addition, a seawater advection-dispersion equation (S-ADE) model is established based on the actual physical processes of radionuclides in the seawater column and well fitting results were obtained (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.49 to 0.99). The <sup>239+240</sup>Pu data and the geographic information from the sample site were used to correct the Pu distribution in the seawater. The calculated <sup>239+240</sup>Pu mean concentrations in the surface seawater were 2.465 mBq/m<sup>3</sup> and 2.205 mBq/m<sup>3</sup> for the SCS and the eastern IND seawater, respectively, and the result is consistent with the previous measurements. Then, the <sup>239+240</sup>Pu stored in the study area of SCS and eastern IND was estimated to be approximately 1.0-1.4% of the global ocean based on the model. This study provides a useful model for guiding and designing future monitoring of pollution by anthropogenic Pu and other isotopes.",2023,12,26

In this study, zebrafish embryos (2 h post-fertilization, hpf) were exposed to four concentrations of SPT (0, 60, 120, and 240 μg/L) until 21 dpf (days post-fertilization). We delved into the mechanisms by examining its potential disruption of the thyroid endocrine system, employing in vivo, in vitro, and in silico assays. The findings showed notable developmental disturbances, including reduced hatching rates, shortened body lengths, and decelerated heart rates. Additionally, there was an increase in malformations and a decline in locomotor activity. Detailed analyses revealed that SPT exposure led to elevated thyroid hormone levels, perturbed the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis transcript levels, amplified deiodinase type I (Dio1) and deiodinase type II (Dio2) activities, and both transcriptionally and proteomically upregulated thyroid receptor beta (TRβ) in larvae. Techniques like molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) confirmed SPT's affinity for TRβ, consistent with in vitro findings suggesting its antagonistic effect on the T3-TR complex. These insights emphasize the need for caution in using tetronic acid-derived insecticides.",2023,12,26
Higenamine inhibits acute and chronic inflammatory pain through modulation of TRPV4 channels.,"Pain is the cardinal symptom of many debilitating diseases and results in heavy health and economic burdens worldwide. Asarum (Asarum sieboldii Miq.) is a commonly used analgesic in Chinese medicine. However, the analgesic components and mechanisms of asarum in acute and chronic pain mice model remain unknown. In this study, we first generated asarum water extract and confirmed strong analgesic properties in mice in both the acute thermal and mechanical pain models, as well as in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) induced chronic inflammatory pain model. Second, we identified higenamine as a major component of asarum and found that higenamine significantly inhibited thermal and mechanical induced acute pain and CFA induced chronic inflammatory pain. Then, using Trpv4<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we found that TRPV4 is necessary for CFA induced thermal and mechanical allodynia, and demonstrated that higenamine analgesia in the CFA model is partly through TRPV4 channel inhibition. Finally, we found that GSK1016790A, a TRPV4 agonist, induced calcium response was significantly inhibited by higenamine in both cultured DRG neurons and TRPV4 transfected HEK293 cells. Consistent with calcium imaging results, higenamine pretreatment also dose-dependently inhibited GSK1016790A induced acute pain. Taken together, our behavior and calcium imaging results demonstrate that the asarum component higenamine inhibits acute and chronic inflammatory pain by modulation of TRPV4 channels.",2023,12,26
Fracture patterns and associated risk factors in pediatric and early adulthood type 1 diabetes: Findings from a nationwide retrospective cohort study.,"People with pediatric and early adulthood type 1 diabetes (T1D) might have a higher fracture risk at several sites compared to the general population.

Orange-spotted grouper IFNh response to NNV or MSRV and its potential antiviral activities.,"Type I interferon (IFN) plays a crucial role in the antiviral immune response. Nervous necrosis virus (NNV) and Micropterus salmoides rhabdovirus (MSRV) are the most important viruses in cultured larvae and juveniles, causing great economic losses to fish farming. To better understand the antiviral activities and immunoregulatory role of IFN from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), EcIFNh was cloned from NNV infected sample. EcIFNh has an open reading frame (ORF) of 552 bp and encodes a polypeptide of 183 amino acids. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that EcIFNh was clustered into the IFNh branch. The tissue distribution analysis revealed that EcIFNh was highly expressed in the liver and brain of healthy orange-spotted grouper. The mRNA levels of EcIFNh were significantly upregulated after poly (I:C) stimulation and NNV or MSRV infection. Furthermore, the promoter of EcIFNh was characterized and significantly activated by EcMDA5, EcMAVS, EcSTING, EcIRF3, and EcIRF7 in the luciferase activity assays. We found that EcIFNh overexpression resisted the replication of NNV and MSRV, while EcIFNh silencing facilitated NNV replication in GB cells. In addition, EcIFNh recombinant protein (rEcIFNh) enhanced the immune response by inducing the expression of ISGs in vivo and in vitro, suggesting the potential application of rEcIFNh for anti-NNV and anti-MSRV. Taken together, our research may offer the foundation for virus-IFN system interaction in orange-spotted grouper.",2023,12,26
Characteristics of Klebsiella pneumoniae pyogenic liver abscess from 2010-2021 in a tertiary teaching hospital of South China.,"Pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) is a severe and potentially fatal infectious disease.

Induction of proteome changes involved in the cloning of mcr-1 and mcr-2 genes in Escherichia coli DH5-α strain to evaluate colistin resistance.,"Plasmid genes, termed mobile colistin resistance-1 (mcr-1) and mobile colistin resistance-2 (mcr-2), are associated with resistance to colistin in Escherichia coli. These mcr genes result in a range of protein modifications contributing to colistin resistance. This study aims to discern the proteomic characteristics of E. coli carrying mcr-1 and mcr-2 genes. Furthermore, it evaluates the expression levels of various proteins under different conditions (with and without colistin).",2023,12,26
"Unraveling fluorescent mechanism of biomass-sourced carbon dots based on three major components: Cellulose, lignin, and protein.","The complexity of biomass components leads to significant variations in the performance of biomass-based carbon dots (CDs). To shed light on this matter, this study presents a comparative analysis of the fluorescence properties of CDs using pure cellulose, lignin, and protein as models. Three CDs showed different fluorescent properties, resulting from the structure difference and carbonization behavior in the hydrothermal. The relatively gentle thermal degradation of proteins allows the macromolecular structure of amino acids to be preserved. This preservation results in a more regular lattice structure, a larger sp<sup>2</sup> domain size, and N-doping, which contribute to the highest quantum yield (QY) of 8.7% of the CDs. In contrast, cellulose undergoes more severe thermal degradation with large amounts of small molecules generated, resulting in the CDs with fewer surface defects, more irregular lattice structures, and lower QY. These results provide a guideline for the design of carbon dots from different biomass.",2023,12,26
Bioresponsive gingerol-loaded alginate-coated niosomal nanoparticles for targeting intracellular bacteria and cancer cells.,"Targeting and treating intracellular pathogen infections has been long-standing challenge, particularly in light of the escalating prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. Herein, an optimum formulation of alginate (AL)-coated niosome-based carriers for delivery of herbal extract Gingerol (Gin) was developed to treat intracellular pathogen infections and cancer cells. We used Gin-Nio@AL as a model drug to assess its efficacy against Gram-negative/positive bacteria and breast cancer cell lines. Our investigation affirmed its heightened antibacterial and anticancer properties. The antibacterial activity of Gin-Nio@AL against intracellular Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) was also tested. In the current study, the niosome nanoparticles containing herbal extract Gingerol were optimized regarding lipid content and Surfactant per Cholesterol molar ratio. The developed formulation provided potential advantages, such as smooth globular surface morphology, small diameter (240.68 nm), pH-sensitive sustained release, and high entrapment efficiency (94.85 %). The release rate of Gin from AL-coated niosomes (Gin-Nio@AL) in physiological and acidic pH is lower than uncoated nanoparticles (Gin-Nio). Besides, the release rate of Gin from niosomal formulations increased in acidic pH. The Gin-Nio@AL demonstrated good antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, and compared to Gin-Nio, the MIC values decreased to 7.82 ± 0.00 and 1.95 ± 0.00 μg/mL, respectively. In addition, the time-kill assay results showed that the developed formulation significantly reduced the number of bacteria in both strains compared to other tested groups. The microtiter data and scanning electron microscope micrography showed that Gin-Nio@AL has a more significant inhibitory effect on biofilm formation than Gin-Nio and Gin. The cell cytotoxicity evaluation showed that Gin-Nio@AL reduced the survival rate of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells to 52.4 % and 45.2 % after 48 h and 72 h, respectively. The elimination of intracellular pathogens was investigated through a breast cancer cell infection in an in vitro model. Gin-Nio@AL exhibited an enhanced and sustained intracellular antibacterial activity against pathogens-infected breast cancer cells compared to other tested formulations. Overall, Gin-Nio@AL enables the triggered release and targeting of intra-extra cellular bacteria and cancer cells and provides a novel and promising candidate for treating intracellular pathogen infections and cancer cells.",2023,12,26
Comparison of the effects of three drying methods on lignin properties.,"In the last few years, a serious effort has been initiated to develop standard methods for lignin characterization at the national and international levels. Thus, several Canadian and ISO standards were recently developed. The current results were generated in an effort to assist the ISO/TC6 Committee come up with a reliable standard method for the measurement of the dry solids content of lignins. In particular, this work investigated the drying of lignin using three different drying methods: conduction oven drying (105 °C), vacuum oven drying at (60 °C), and freeze drying. Ten different lignins were used in this study including wet and air-dried softwood and hardwood kraft lignins in the acid and base forms from the industrial LignoForce™ process and hydrolysis lignin from the TMP-Bio™ process. The results showed that 7 h, 48 h and 24 h were sufficient to reach a constant solids content in the case of all lignins when oven drying, vacuum oven drying under negative pressure (150 mbar), and freeze drying (25 mT) were used, respectively. Kraft lignins in the base form showed higher sensitivity to degradation compared to lignins in the acid form. The total hydroxyl group content of air-dried and wet hardwood lignins in the base form decreased by more than 50 % after vacuum oven-drying for 71.5 h or oven-drying for 16 h compared to freeze-drying for 68 h. The decrease in the total hydroxyl groups was more pronounced (70 %) when the wet softwood lignin in the base form was dried in the oven compared to freeze drying for 68 h.",2023,12,27
The chromatin remodeler Ino80 regulates yeast stress tolerance and cell metabolism through modulating nitrogen catabolite repression.,"Chromatin remodelers are important in maintaining the dynamic chromatin state in eukaryotic cells, which is essential for epigenetic regulation. Among the remodelers, the multi-subunits complex INO80 plays crucial roles in transcriptional regulation. However, current knowledge of chromatin regulation of the core subunit Ino80 on stress adaptation remains mysterious. Here we revealed that overexpressing the chromatin remodeler Ino80 elevated tolerance to multiple stresses in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analyses of differential chromatin accessibility and global transcription levels revealed an enrichment of genes involved in NCR (nitrogen catabolite repression) under acetic acid stress. We demonstrated that Ino80 overexpression reduced the histone H3 occupancy in the promoter region of the glutamate dehydrogenase gene GDH2 and the allantoinase gene DAL1. Consistently, the decreased occupancy of nucleosome was revealed in the Ino80-inactivation mutant. Further analyses showed that Ino80 was recruited to the specific DNA locus in the promoter region of GDH2. Consistently, Ino80 overexpression facilitated the utilization of non-preferred nitrogen source to enhance ethanol yield under prolonged acetic acid stress. These results demonstrate that Ino80 plays a crucial role in coordinating carbon and nitrogen metabolism during stress adaptation.",2023,12,27
"Bioinspired multiscale cellulose/lignin-silver composite films with robust mechanical, antioxidant and antibacterial properties for ultraviolet shielding.","Constructing a high-performance ultraviolet shielding film is an effective way for addressing the growing problem of ultraviolet radiation. However, it is still a great challenge to achieve a combination of multifunctional, excellent mechanical properties and low cost. Here, inspired by the multiscale structure of biomaterials and features of lignin, a multifunctional composite film (CNF/CMF/Lig-Ag) is constructed via a facile vacuum-filtration method by introducing micron-sized cellulose fibers (CMF) and lignin-silver nanoparticles (Lig-Ag NPs) into the cellulose nanofibers (CNF) film network. In this composite film, the microfibers interweave with nanofibers to form a multiscale three-dimensional network, which ensures satisfactory mechanical properties of the composite film. Meanwhile, the Lig-Ag NPs are employed as a multifunctional filler to enhance the composite film's antioxidant, antibacterial and ultraviolet shielding abilities. As a result, the prepared CNF/CMF/Lig-Ag composite film demonstrates excellent mechanical properties (with tensile strength of 133.8 MPa and fracture strain of 7.4 %), good biocompatibility, high thermal stability, potent antioxidant and antibacterial properties. More importantly, such composite film achieves a high ultraviolet shielding rate of 98.2 % for ultraviolet radiation A (UVA) and 99.4 % for ultraviolet radiation B (UVB), respectively. Therefore, the prepared CNF/CMF/Lig-Ag composite film shows great potential in application of ultraviolet protection.",2023,12,26
"Unusual rearrangements of mitogenomes in Diptera revealed by comparative analysis of 135 tachinid species (Insecta, Diptera, Tachinidae).","The Tachinidae is one of the most speciose families in Diptera, and the exclusively parasitoid species play an important role in regulating populations of many herbivorous insects in ecosystems, including many agricultural pests. To better comprehend the characteristics and evolution of the mitochondrial genome for the Tachinidae, we are adding a massive amount of new molecular data by assembling the mitogenomes for 71 genera and 135 species from all four tachinid subfamilies through next-generation sequencing, and we are presenting the most comprehensive mitogenomic phylogenetic analysis of this family so far. Extensive rearrangements observed in the mitogenome of Admontia podomyia (Exoristinae) are unique for the entire suborder Cyclorrhapha. The rearrangement pattern suggests that the process involved a tandem duplication of the complete mitogenome, followed by both random and nonrandom loss of one copy of each gene. Additionally, five minor mitogenome rearrangements are discovered and described in three subfamilies. We present the largest species-level phylogenetic hypothesis for Tachinidae to date, based on mitogenomes of 152 species of Tachinidae, representing all four subfamilies and with five non-tachinid outgroups. Our analyses support the monophyly of the Tachinidae and most tribes and genera were recovered with good support, but the higher-level phylogenetic relationships within Tachinidae were poorly resolved, indicating that mitogenome data alone are not enough to unambiguously resolve the deeper phylogenetic relationships within Tachinidae.",2023,12,26
msqrob2PTM: differential abundance and differential usage analysis of MS-based proteomics data at the post-translational modification and peptidoform level.,"In the era of open-modification search engines, more post-translational modifications than ever can be detected by LC-MS/MS-based proteomics. This development can switch proteomics research into a higher gear, as PTMs are key in many cellular pathways important in cell proliferation, migration, metastasis and ageing. However, despite these advances in modification identification, statistical methods for PTM-level quantification and differential analysis have yet to catch up. This absence can partly be explained by statistical challenges inherent to the data, such as the confounding of PTM intensities with its parent protein abundance. Therefore, we have developed msqrob2PTM, a new workflow in the msqrob2 universe capable of differential abundance analysis at the PTM, and at the peptidoform level. The latter is important for validating PTMs found as significantly differential. Indeed, as our method can deal with multiple PTMs per peptidoform, there is a possibility that significant PTMs stem from one significant peptidoform carrying another PTM, hinting that it might be the other PTM driving the perceived differential abundance. Our workflows can flag both Differential Peptidoform (PTM) Abundance (DPA) and Differential Peptidoform (PTM) Usage (DPU). This enables a distinction between direct assessment of differential abundance of peptidoforms (DPA) and differences in the relative usage of peptidoforms corrected for corresponding protein abundances (DPU). For DPA, we directly model the log2-transformed peptidoform (PTM) intensities, while for DPU, we correct for parent protein abundance by an intermediate normalisation step which calculates the log2-ratio of the peptidoform (PTM) intensities to their summarized parent protein intensities. We demonstrated the utility and performance of msqrob2PTM by applying it to datasets with known ground truth, as well as to biological PTM-rich datasets. Our results show that msqrob2PTM is on par with, or surpassing the performance of, the current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, msqrob2PTM is currently unique in providing output at the peptidoform level.",2023,12,26

Molecular characterization of large cell calcifying sertoli cell tumors: A multi-institutional study of 6 benign and 2 malignant tumors.,"Large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumors (LCCSCTs) are rare testicular tumors, representing <1 % of all testicular neoplasms. Almost 40 % of patients with LCCSCTs will present in the context of the inherited tumor predisposition syndrome, the Carney complex. While most LCCSCTs are benign, 10-20 % have malignant behavior. The aim of our study was to analyze LCCSCTs for novel molecular alterations in addition to PRKAR1A mutations and to identify potential drivers for malignant progression. Eight LCCSCTs diagnosed at two institutions were included. Two patients had the Carney complex confirmed on subsequent genetic testing, and two tumors had several adverse pathological findings. One patient presented with metastatic disease at the time of initial diagnosis. Targeted next-generation sequencing detected PRKAR1A alterations in all cases, with heterozygous PRKAR1A mutations in 5 tumors, germline Carney-complex-associated PRKAR1A mutation in 2 patients, and PRKAR1A fusion in 1 tumor. Additionally, sequencing the metastatic case identified CDKN1B and TERT promoter gene mutations. All tumors showed a low tumoral mutational burden and unremarkable copy number alterations except for frequent LOH of 17q24 encompassing the PRKAR1A locus. RNA expression analysis showed increased expression of several markers including novel PRUNE2, and usual markers like inhibin and calretinin. Our study showed that while LCCSCTs have been reported in the setting of cancer predisposition syndromes, the majority of these tumors occur sporadically. PRKAR1A alterations were present in all cases and appear to be the major driver in LCCSCTs. It remains to be determined whether malignant progression may be caused by additional driver mutations.",2023,12,26
"Diode characteristics, piezo-photocatalytic antibiotic degradation and hydrogen production of Ce<sup>3+</sup> doped ZnO nanostructures.","Piezo-photocatalysis of ZnO nanostructures had recently well attracted due to their exceptional potential in degrading the antibiotics and scalable hydrogen production.

Utilization of carbon-based nanomaterials for wastewater treatment and biogas enhancement: A state-of-the-art review.,"The management of environmental pollution and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions is a challenge that has spurred increased research interest in determining sustainable alternatives to decrease biowaste. This state-of-the-art review aimed to describe the preparation and utilization of carbon-based nanomaterials (CNM) for biogas enhancement and wastewater contaminant (dyes, color, and dust particles) removal. The novelty of this review is that we elucidated that the performance of CNMs in the anaerobic digestion (AD) varies from one system to another. In addition, this review revealed that increasing the pyrolysis temperature can facilitate the transition from one CNM type to another and outlined the methods that can be used to develop CNMs, including arc discharge, chemical exfoliation, and laser ablation. In addition, this study showed that methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) yield can be slightly increased (e.g. from 33.6% to 60.89%) depending on certain CNM factors, including its type, concentration, and feedstock. Temperature is a fundamental factor involved in the method and carbon sources used for CNM synthesis. This review determined that graphene oxide is not a good additive for biogas and CH<sub>4</sub> yield improvement compared with other types of CNM, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes. The efficacy of CNMs in wastewater treatment depends on the temperature and pH of the solution. Therefore, CNMs are good adsorbents for wastewater contaminant removal and are a promising alternative for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reduction. Further research is necessary to determine the relationship between CNM synthesis and preparation costs while accounting for other factors such as gas flow, feedstock, consumption time, and energy consumption.",2023,12,26

The therapeutic role of SSEA3(+) human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells in ischemic stroke model.,"Numerous evidences showed that human umbilical cord blood (UCB) mononuclear cells were a promising approach for the therapy of ischemic stroke(IS). The effect of stage-specific embryonic antigen 3 (SSEA3）positive subpopulation in UCB was not investigated in IS. In this study, we isolated SSEA3 positive cells from healthy UCB mononuclear cells, which comprised about 7.01% of the total UCB-mononuclear cells. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that SSEA3(+)UCB cells were almost positive for CD44 and CD45, and negative for CD73, CD90 and CD105. The expression of Oct3/4 in SSEA3(+)UCB cells were higher than that in UCB. SSEA3(+)UCB cells sorted by magnetic cell sorting were intravenously injected into the middle cerebral arterial occlusion(MCAO) rat model. Neurological score showed that SSEA3(+)UCB transplantation group exhibited significant improvements in the functional outcome of MCAO rats than UCB transplantation group. Nissl staining and microtubule association protein-2(MAP2) immunofluorescence staining showed that the SSEA3(+)UCB transplantation group decreased neuronal loss. SSEA3(+)UCB transplantation group reduced neuronal apoptosis, inhibited caspase3 expression, and decreased tumor necrosis factor α(TNF-α).

"HIV DRUG RESISTANCE AMONG PATIENTS EXPIRIENCING ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY FAILURE IN RUSSIA, 2019-2021.","Increasing HIV drug resistance is an important public health concern. The current study aimed to assess HIV drug resistance among people who live with HIV (PLWH) experiencing virological failure. Blood samples and epidemiological characteristics were collected in four Siberian regions from PLWH experiencing ART failure. Partial pol gene sequences were obtained for the study individuals. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were predicted using the Stanford HIVdb Program. The association of HIV DRM with epidemiological characteristics was estimated using logistic regression analysis. Further analysis was performed for children (0-14 years old) and adults (≥15 years old) separately. In total, 815 (89.4%) patients were included in the final dataset. Overall, 501 (61.5%) patients had DRM detected. NRTI DRM was more common in children, while NRTI+NNRTI DRM was more frequent in adults (p<0.001). Krasnoyarsk region, male sex, and high viral load were positively associated with the presence of DRM in adults, while higher CD4 cell count and PI/INSTI-based ART had a negative association. No association between epidemiological characteristics and DRM was identified in children. The remaining 38.5% of patients with virological failure had no DRM detected; those patients were likely to have insufficient ART adherence. Most (55.5%) patients had HIV CRF63_02A6, followed by sub-subtype A6 (39.2%). This study revealed poor ART adherence as a main factor driving ART failure among PLWH in the Siberian region. DRM was detected in over 60% of PLWH experiencing ART failure. The current results highlight an urgent need for the introduction of special programs focusing on ART adherence improvement.",2023,12,26
A novel tiRNA-Glu-CTC induces nanoplastics accelerated vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching and vascular injury through mitochondrial damage.,"Nanoplastics pose several health hazards, especially vascular toxicity. Transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) are novel noncoding RNAs associated with different pathological processes. However, their biological roles and mechanisms in aberrant vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) plasticity and vascular injury are unclear. This study investigated the potent effects of tsRNAs on vascular injury induced by short- and long-term exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs). Mice were exposed to PS-NPs (100 nm) at different doses (10-100 μg/mL) for 30 or 180 days. High-throughput sequencing was used to analyze tsRNA expression patterns in arterial tissues obtained from an in vivo model. Additionally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, fluorescent in situ hybridization assays, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to measure the expression and impact of tiRNA-Glu-CTC on VSMCs exposed to PS-NPs. Short-term (≥50 μg/mL, moderate concentration) and long-term (≥10 μg/mL, low concentration) PS-NP exposure induced vascular injury in vivo. Cellular experiments showed that the moderate concentration of PS-NPs induced VSMC phenotypic switching, whereas a high concentration of PS-NPs (100 μg/mL) promoted VSMC apoptosis. PS-NP induced severe mitochondrial damage in VSMCs, including overexpression of reactive oxygen species, accumulation of mutated mtDNA, and dysregulation of genes related to mitochondrial synthesis and division. Compared with the control group, 13 upregulated and 12 downregulated tRNA-derived stress-induced RNAs (tiRNAs) were observed in the long-term PS-NP (50 μg/mL) exposure group. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that differentially expressed tiRNAs targeted genes that were involved in vascular smooth muscle contraction and calcium signaling pathways. Interestingly, tiRNA-Glu-CTC was overexpressed in vivo and in vitro following PS-NP exposure. Functionally, the tiRNA-Glu-CTC inhibitor mitigated VSMC phenotypic switching and mitochondrial damage induced by PS-NP exposure, whereas tiRNA-Glu-CTC mimics had the opposite effect. Mechanistically, tiRNA-Glu-CTC mimics induced VSMC phenotypic switching by downregulating Cacna1f expression. PS-NP exposure promoted VSMC phenotypic switching and vascular injury by targeting the tiRNA-Glu-CTC/Cacna1f axis.",2023,12,26

In this study, concentrations of 45 trace elements and stable C, N, and Pb isotopes were used to distinguish Cordyceps sinensis samples from different habitats and different varieties (natural and artificial). The results showed that there were significant differences in the isotope compositions of N and Pb and trace elements contents in the Cordyceps sinensis samples from different sources. Stepwise discriminant analysis was used to select effective traceability indicators, and three discriminant models were successfully established. A combination of Co, Sr, Cu, Tl, and Zr indexes was selected to distinguish the naturally grown samples from the artificially cultivated ones, with an overall cross-validation correctness rate of 90.0 %; while a combination of As, Cu, Rb, Tl, W, and Zr indexes was adopted to distinguish the naturally grown samples from different regions, with a corresponding 100.0 % overall cross-validation correctness rate. To simultaneously distinguish samples between natural and artificial and between different regions, a combination of As, Cu, Rb, Tl, U, W, and δ<sup>15</sup>N indexes was employed, with an overall cross-validation correctness rate of 89.3 %.",2023,12,27
"Science of forests and floods: The quantum leap forward needed, literally and metaphorically.","A century of research has generated considerable disagreement on the effect of forests on floods. Here we call for a causal inference framework to advance the science and management of the effect of any forest or its removal on flood severity and frequency. The causes of floods are multiple and chancy and, hence, can only be investigated via a probabilistic approach. We use the stochastic hydrology literature to infer a blueprint framework which could guide future research on the understanding and prediction of the effects of forests on floods in environments where rain is the dominant form of precipitation. Drawing parallels from other disciplines, we show that the introduction of probability in forest hydrology could stimulate a gestalt switch in the science of forests and floods. In light of increasing flood risk caused by climate change, this probabilistic framework can help policymakers develop robust forest and water management plans based on a defensible and clear understanding of floods.",2023,12,26
Microplastics and associated chemicals in drinking water: A review of their occurrence and human health implications.,"Microplastics (MPs) have entered drinking water (DW) via various pathways, raising concerns about their potential health impacts. This study provides a comprehensive review of MP-associated chemicals, such as oligomers, plasticizers, stabilizers, and ultraviolet (UV) filters that can be leached out during DW treatment and distribution. The leaching of these chemicals is influenced by various environmental and operating factors, with three major ones identified: MP concentration and polymer type, pH, and contact time. The leaching process is substantially enhanced during the disinfection step of DW treatment, due to ultraviolet light and/or disinfectant-triggered reactions. The study also reviewed human exposure to MPs and associated chemicals in DW, as well as their health impacts on the human nervous, digestive, reproductive, and hepatic systems, especially the neuroendocrine toxicity of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. An overview of MPs in DW, including tap water and bottled water, was also presented to enable a background understanding of MPs-associated chemicals. In short, certain chemicals leached from MPs in DW can have significant implications for human health and demand further research on their long-term health impacts, mitigation strategies, and interactions with other pollutants such as disinfection byproducts (DBPs) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). This study is anticipated to facilitate the research and management of MPs in DW and beverages.",2023,12,27
The effect of mitochondrial recombination on fertilization success in blue mussels.,"The presence of doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI) in bivalves represents a unique mode of mitochondrial transmission, whereby paternal (male-transmitted M-type) and maternal (female-transmitted F-type) haplotypes are transmitted to offspring separately. Male embryos retain both haplotypes, but the M-type is selectively removed from females. Due to the presence of heteroplasmy in males, mtDNA can recombine resulting in a 'masculinized' haplotype referred to as M<sup>f</sup>-type. While mtDNA recombination is usually rare, it has been recorded in multiple mussel species across the Northern Hemisphere. Given that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, different mtDNA haplotypes may have different selective advantages under diverse environmental conditions. This may be particularly important for sperm fitness and fertilization success. In this study we aimed to i) determine the presence, prevalence of the M<sup>f</sup>-type in Australian blue mussels (Mytilus sp.) and ii) investigate the effect of M<sup>f</sup>-mtDNA on sperm performance (a fitness correlate). We found a high prevalence of recombined mtDNA (≈35 %) located within the control region of the mitochondrial genome, which occurred only in specimens that contained Southern Hemisphere mtDNA. The presence of two female mitotypes were identified in the studied mussels, one likely originating from the Northern Hemisphere, and the other either representing the endemic M. planulatus species or introduced genotypes from the Southern Hemisphere. Despite having recombination events present in a third of the studied population, analysis of sperm performance indicated no difference in fertilization success related to mitotype.",2023,12,26
Screening for Palliative Care Need in Oncology: Validation of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures.,"Leading oncology societies recommend monitoring symptoms and support needs through patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), but their use for assessing specialist palliative care (SPC) need has not yet been explored.

Influence of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) on Pressure Pain Thresholds and Conditioned Pain Modulation in a Randomized Controlled Trial in Women With Fibromyalgia.,"Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) effectively reduces pain in fibromyalgia (FM). The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of TENS use on pressure pain thresholds (PPT) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) in individuals with FM using data from the Fibromyalgia Activity Study with TENS trial (NCT01888640). Individuals with FM were randomly assigned to receive active TENS, placebo TENS, or no TENS for 4 weeks. A total of 238 females satisfied the per-protocol analysis among the active TENS (n = 76), placebo TENS (n = 68), and no TENS (n = 94) groups. Following 4 weeks of group allocation, the active TENS group continued for an additional 4 weeks of active TENS totaling 8 weeks (n = 66), the placebo and no TENS groups transitioned to receive 4 weeks of active TENS (delayed TENS, n = 161). Assessment of resting pain, movement-evoked pain (MEP), PPT, and CPM occurred prior to and following active, placebo, or no TENS. There were no significant changes in PPT or CPM among the active TENS, placebo TENS, or no TENS groups after 4 weeks. Individuals who reported clinically relevant improvements in MEP (≥30% decrease) demonstrated increases in PPT (P < .001), but not CPM, when compared to MEP non-responders. There were no significant correlations among the change in PPT or CPM compared to MEP and resting pain following active TENS use (active TENS + delayed TENS). PPT and CPM may provide insight to underlying mechanisms contributing to pain; however, these measures may not relate to self-reported pain symptoms. PERSPECTIVE: Pressure pain threshold increased in individuals with clinically relevant improvement (≥30%) in MEP, indicating the clinical relevance of PPT for understanding mechanisms contributing to pain. CPM was not a reliable indicator of treatment response in MEP responders.",2023,12,26
NLRP3-GSDMD-dependent IL-1β secretion from microglia mediates learning and memory impairment in a chronic intermittent hypoxia-induced mouse model.,"Hypoxia/reoxygenation caused by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) plays an important role in cognitive deficits in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. However, the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study investigated whether the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is involved in CIH-induced spatial learning and memory impairment in mice, and the possible underlying upstream and downstream mechanisms. The C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to CIH (21% O<sub>2</sub>-6% O<sub>2</sub>, 4 min/cycle, 8 h/day) for 9 weeks to investigate the role of NLRP3 in CIH-induced spatial learning and memory impairment in mice. BV2 cells were exposed to intermittent hypoxia (21% O<sub>2</sub>-1% O<sub>2</sub>, 90 min/cycle) for 48 h to investigate the possible mechanisms in vitro. We found that: 1) inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation improved CIH-induced spatial learning and memory impairment in mice. 2) CIH damaged hippocampal neurons but increased the number of microglia in mice hippocampi; CIH activated microglia-specific NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to upregulation of matured IL-1β and N-GSDMD. 3) intermittent hypoxia activated NLRP3 inflammasome via the ROS-NF-κB signaling pathway to promote the release of matured IL-1β from microglia in a GSDMD-dependent manner without pyroptosis. 4) The IL-1β released from microglia might impair the synaptic plasticity of hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses by acting on IL-1 receptors in hippocampal neurons. Our findings reveal that ROS-NF-κB-NLRP3 inflammasome-GSDMD dependent IL-1β release from microglia may participate in CIH-induced spatial learning and memory impairment by acting on hippocampal neuronal IL-1 receptor, leading to synaptic plasticity impairment.",2023,12,26

"Inactivation of Ymr1, Sjl2/3 phosphatases promotes stress resistance and longevity in wild type and Ras2G19V yeast.","In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ras (RAt Sarcoma) activity plays a central role in mediating the effect of glucose in decreasing stress resistance and longevity, with constitutive Ras activation mutations promoting cell growth and oncogenesis. Here, we used transposon mutagenesis in yeast to identify suppressors of the constitutively active Ras2G19V, orthologue of the KRASG12C mammalian oncogene. We identified mutations in YMR1 (Yeast Myotubularin Related), SJL2 (SynaptoJanin-Like) and SJL3 phosphatases, which target phosphatidylinositol phosphates, as the most potent suppressors of constitutive active Ras, able to reverse its effect on stress sensitization and sufficient to extend longevity. In sjl2 mutants, the staining of Ras-GTP switched from membrane-associated to a diffuse cytoplasmic staining, suggesting that it may block Ras activity by preventing its localization. Whereas expression of the Slj2 PI 3,4,5 phosphatase mediated stress sensitization in both the Ras2G19V and wild type backgrounds, overexpression of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase VPS34 (Vacuolar Protein Sorting), promoted heat shock sensitization only in the Ras2G19V background, suggesting a complex relationship between different phosphatidylinositol and stress resistance. These results provide potential targets to inhibit the growth of cancer cells with constitutive Ras activity and link the glucose-dependent yeast pro-aging Ras signaling pathway to the well-established pro-aging PI3K (PhosphoInositide 3-Kinase) pathway in worms and other species and raise the possibility that the longevity effect of mutations in the PI3K-AKT (AK strain Transforming) pathway may involve inhibition of Ras signaling.",2023,12,26
Efficacy and safety of ivermectin in patients with mild COVID-19 in Japan and Thailand.,"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug administered to hundreds of millions of people worldwide.

Inefficient transcription is a production bottleneck for artificial therapeutic BiTE® proteins.,"Antibodies are potent biopharmaceuticals used to treat severe diseases, including cancers. During the past decade, more complex modalities have been developed including bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE®) molecules, e.g. by Amgen. However, non-natural and complex molecule formats often prove to be difficult-to-express (DTE), which is the case for BiTE® molecules. Due to the growing importance of multispecific modalities such as half-life extended (HLE) BiTE® and HLE dual-targeting bispecific T-cell engager (dBiTE) molecules, this artificial class of therapeutic proteins was investigated for molecular bottlenecks in stable production cell lines, by analyzing all relevant steps of recombinant protein production. As a result, drastically reduced intracellular BiTE® molecule-encoding mRNA levels were identified as a potential production bottleneck. Using in vitro transcription (IVT), the transcription rate of the BiTE® molecule-encoding mRNA was identified as the root cause for reduced amounts of intracellular mRNA. In an attempt to improve the transcription rate of a BiTE® molecule, it could be demonstrated that the artificial and special structure of the BiTE® molecule was not the rate limiting step for reduced IVT rate. However, modulation of the primary DNA sequence led to significant improvement of IVT rate. The analyses presented provide insight into the HLE BiTE® / HLE d(BiTE®) class of DTE proteins and perhaps into other classes of DTE proteins, and therefore may lead to identification of further production bottlenecks and optimization strategies to overcome manufacturability challenges associated with various complex therapeutics.",2023,12,26
In pursuit of a minimal CHO genome: Establishment of large-scale genome deletions.,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the most commonly used mammalian cell line for the production of complex therapeutic glycoproteins. As CHO cells have evolved as part of a multicellular organism, they harbor many cellular functions irrelevant for their application as production hosts in industrial bioprocesses. Consequently, CHO cells have been the target for numerous genetic engineering efforts in the past, but a tailored host cell chassis holistically optimized for its specific task in a bioreactor is still missing. While the concept of genome reduction has already been successfully applied to bacterial production cells, attempts to create higher eukaryotic production hosts exhibiting reduced genomes have not been reported yet. Here, we present the establishment and application of a large-scale genome deletion strategy for targeted excision of large genomic regions in CHO cells. We demonstrate the feasibility of genome reduction in CHO cells using optimized CRISPR/Cas9 based experimental protocols targeting large non-essential genomic regions with high efficiency. Achieved genome deletions of non-essential genetic regions did not introduce negative effects on bioprocess relevant parameters, although we conducted the largest reported genomic excision of 864 kilobase pairs in CHO cells so far. The concept presented serves as a directive to accelerate the development of a significantly genome-reduced CHO host cell chassis paving the way for a next generation of CHO cell factories.",2023,12,27

Citronellal can alleviate vascular endothelial dysfunction by reducing ectopic miR-133a expression.,"Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is the initial cause of atherosclerosis (AS) and an early marker of many cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Citronellal (CT), a monoterpenoid natural product extracted from grass plant Citronella, has been shown to have anti-thrombotic, anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic cardiomyopathy activities. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of citronellal on vascular endothelial dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms.",2023,12,26
Defects in AMPAR trafficking and microglia activation underlie socio-cognitive deficits associated to decreased expression of phosphodiesterase 2 a.,"Phosphodiesterase 2 A (PDE2A) is an enzyme involved in the homeostasis of cAMP and cGMP and is the most highly expressed PDE in human brain regions critical for socio-cognitive behavior. In cerebral cortex and hippocampus, PDE2A expression level is upregulated in Fmr1-KO mice, a model of the Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Indeed, PDE2A translation is negatively modulated by FMRP, whose functional absence causes FXS. While the pharmacological inhibition of PDE2A has been associated to its pro-cognitive role in normal animals and in models of ID and ASD, homozygous PDE2A mutations have been identified in patients affected by ID, ASD and epilepsy. To clarify this apparent paradox about the role of PDE2A in brain development, we characterized here Pde2a<sup>+/-</sup> mice (homozygote animals being not viable) at the behavioral, cellular, molecular and electrophysiological levels. Pde2a<sup>+/-</sup> females display a milder form of the disorder with reduced cognitive performance in adulthood, conversely males show severe socio-cognitive deficits throughout their life. In males, these phenotypes are associated with microglia activation, elevated glutathione levels and increased externalization of Glutamate receptor (GluR1) in CA1, producing reduced mGluR-dependent Long-term Depression. Overall, our results reveal molecular targets of the PDE2A-dependent pathway underlying socio-cognitive performance. These results clarify the mechanism of action of pro-cognitive drugs based on PDE2A inactivation, which have been shown to be promising therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, FXS as well as other forms of ASD.",2023,12,26
Relationship between schematic and dynamic expectations of melodic patterns in music perception.,"Prediction is fundamental in music listening. Two types of expectations have been proposed: schematic expectations, which arise from knowledge of tonal regularities (e.g., harmony and key) acquired through long-term plasticity and learning, and dynamic expectations, which arise from short-term regularity representations (e.g., rhythmic patterns and melodic contours) extracted from ongoing musical contexts. Although both expectations are indispensable in music listening, how they interact with each other in music prediction remains unclear. The present study examined the relationship between schematic and dynamic expectations in music processing using event-related potentials (ERPs). At the ending note of the melodies, the schematic expectation was violated by presenting a note with music-syntactic irregular (i.e., outof- key note), while the dynamic expectation was violated by presenting a contour deviant based on online statistical learning of melodic patterns. Schematic and dynamic expectations were manipulated to predict the same note. ERPs were recorded for the music-syntactic irregularity and the contour deviant, which occurred independently or simultaneously. The results showed that the music-syntactic irregularity elicited an early right anterior negativity (ERAN), reflecting the prediction error in the schematic expectation, while the contour deviant elicited a mismatch negativity (MMN), reflecting the prediction error in the dynamic expectation. Both components occurred within a similar latency range. Moreover, the ERP amplitude was multiplicatively increased when the irregularity and deviance occurred simultaneously. These findings suggest that schematic and dynamic expectations function concurrently in an interactive manner when both expectations predict the same note.",2023,12,26
Bipolarity in Older individuals Living without Drugs (BOLD): Protocol and preliminary findings.,"Although clinical guidelines regard prophylactic medication as the cornerstone of treatment, it is estimated almost half of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) live without medication.

We aim to describe the clinical phenotype of patients diagnosed with BD who have discontinued maintenance treatment.",2023,12,27
A segmentation and characterization of consumers affected by rising food prices.,"The food price inflation in 2022 has put considerable pressure on some consumers, leading to changes in their food choice and consumption behavior. To gain a better understanding of consumers' responses to rising food prices, we conducted an online survey among 1000 consumers in Germany, in which they were asked to self-report the extent of their changes during a period from the beginning of 2022 to November 2022. A principal component analysis was conducted to summarize the queried items into three factors, which were subsequently used for a cluster analysis. The emerging clusters were characterized in terms of sociodemographic as well as psychographic variables, namely locus of control, life satisfaction, optimism, pessimism, human values, and food values. The segment that appears to be most affected by rising food prices consists of about 28% of the sample's respondents and is characterized by a strong engagement in saving behaviors. These consumers are less satisfied with their lives and more pessimistic, corresponding to their lower incomes and lower likelihood to be fully employed. Communication and policy measures need to be designed in a way that these consumers regain stability and become more confident about the future.",2023,12,26
Green rGO/FeNPs nanocomposites activated peroxydisulfate for the removal of mixed 17β-estradiol and estriol.,"Reduced graphene oxide/iron nanoparticles (rGO/FeNPs) synthesized by the chemical method have been used in Fenton oxidation of organic contaminants, yet little is known about biosynthesized rGO/FeNPs using green tea extract (GT) as how to activate persulfate in sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation processes. In this study, rGO/FeNPs were used to activate peroxydisulfate (PDS) for 17β-estradiol (βE<sub>2</sub>) and estriol (E<sub>3</sub>) removal. The rGO/FeNPs-PDS system removed 83.6% of βE<sub>2</sub> and 62.5% of E<sub>3</sub> within 240 min, which was confirmed by a combination of adsorption and degradation via both radical and non-radical pathways. Four main reactive species in βE<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>3</sub> degradation were observed, i.e., hydroxyl radical (·OH), sulfate radical (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>·-</sup>), singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) and electron transfer, with the respective contributions of ·OH (32.9 and 34.7%), SO<sub>4</sub><sup>·-</sup> (16.1 and 19.7%), <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> (12.2 and 14.1%) and electron transfer (8.0 and 7.2%). Analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and electrochemical measurements all indicated that beside the well-known role of Fe, CO from rGO through the generation of ·OH, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>·-</sup>, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and electron transfer, as well as GT through electron transfer also participated in the activation of PDS. Finally, the degradation pathways of βE<sub>2</sub>/E<sub>3</sub> were proposed. Overall, this study provides a new insight into the biosynthesis of rGO/FeNPs to activate PDS for the oxidation of mixed emerging contaminants.",2023,12,26
Glomerular transcriptomics predicts long term outcome and identifies therapeutic strategies for patients with assumed benign IgA nephropathy.,"Some patients diagnosed with benign IgA nephropathy (IgAN) develop a progressive clinical course, not predictable by known clinical or histopathological parameters. To assess if gene expression can differentiate between progressors and non-progressors with assumed benign IgAN, we tested microdissected glomeruli from archival kidney biopsy sections from adult patients with stable clinical remission (21 non-progressors) or from 15 patients that had undergone clinical progression within a 25-year time frame. Based on 1 240 differentially expressed genes from patients with suitable sequencing results, we identified eight IgAN progressor and nine non-progressor genes using a two-component classifier. These genes, including APOL5 and ZXDC, predicted disease progression with 88% accuracy, 75% sensitivity and 100% specificity on average 21.6 years before progressive disease was clinically documented. APOL lipoproteins are associated with inflammation, autophagy and kidney disease while ZXDC is a zinc-finger transcription factor modulating adaptive immunity. Ten genes from our transcriptomics data overlapped with an external genome wide association study dataset, although the gene set enrichment test was not statistically significant. We also identified 45 drug targets in the DrugBank database, including angiotensinogen, a target of sparsentan (dual antagonist of the endothelin type A receptor and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor) currently investigated for IgAN treatment. Two validation cohorts were used for substantiating key results, one by immunohistochemistry and the other by nCounter technology. Thus, glomerular mRNA sequencing from diagnostic kidney biopsies from patients with assumed benign IgAN can differentiate between future progressors and non-progressors at the time of diagnosis.",2023,12,26
A comparative urinary proteomic and metabolomic analysis between renal aa amyloidosis and membranous nephropathy with clinicopathologic correlations.,"Urinary omics has become a powerful tool for elucidating pathophysiology of glomerular diseases. However, no urinary omics analysis has been performed yet on renal AA amyloidosis. Here, we performed a comparative urine proteomic and metabolomic analysis between recently diagnosed renal AA amyloidosis (AA) and membranous nephropathy (MN) patients. Urine samples of 22 (8 AA, 8 MN and 6 healthy control) patients were analyzed with nLC-MS/MS and GC/MS for proteomic and metabolomic studies, respectively. Pathological specimens were scored for glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis grades. Functional enrichment analysis between AA and control groups showed enrichment in cell adhesion related sub-domains. Uromodulin (UMOD) was lower, whereas ribonuclease 1 (RNase1) and α-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor (AMBP) were higher in AA compared to MN group. Correlations were demonstrated between UMOD-proteinuria (r = -0.48, p = 0.03) and AMBP-eGFR (r = -0.69, p = 0.003) variables. Metabolomic analysis showed myo-inositol and urate were higher in AA compared to MN group. A positive correlation was detected between RNase1 and urate independent of eGFR values (r = 0.63, p = 0.01). Enrichment in cell adhesion related domains suggested a possible increased urinary shear stress due to amyloid fibrils. UMOD, AMBP and myo-inositol were related with tubulointerstitial damage, whereas RNase1 and urate were believed to be related with systemic inflammation in AA amyloidosis. SIGNIFICANCE: Urinary omics studies have become a standard tool for biomarker studies. However, no urinary omics analysis has been performed yet on renal AA amyloidosis. Here, we performed a comparative urinary omics analysis between recently diagnosed renal AA amyloidosis (AA), membranous nephropathy (MN) patients and healthy controls. Pathological specimens were scored with glomerulosclerosis (G) and tubulointerstitial fibrosis (IF) grades to consolidate the results of the omics studies and correlation analyzes. Functional enrichment analysis showed enrichment in cell adhesion related sub-domains due to downregulation of cadherins; which could be related with increased urinary shear stress due to amyloid deposition and disruption of tissue micro-architecture. In comparative proteomic analyzes UMOD was lower, whereas RNase1 and AMBP were higher in AA compared to MN group. Whereas in metabolomic analyzes; myo-inositol, urate and maltose were higher in AA compared to MN group. Correlations were demonstrated between UMOD-proteinuria (r = -0.48, p = 0.03), AMBP-eGFR (r = -0.69, p = 0.003) and between RNase1-Urate independent of eGFR values (r = 0.63, p = 0.01). This study is the first comprehensive urinary omics analysis focusing on renal AA Amyloidosis to the best of our knowledge. Based on physiologic roles and clinicopathologic correlations of the molecules; UMOD, AMBP and myo-inositol were related with tubulointerstitial damage, whereas RNase1 and urate were believed to be increased with systemic inflammation and endothelial damage in AA amyloidosis.",2023,12,26
Sinularin stabilizes FOXO3 protein to trigger prostate cancer cell intrinsic apoptosis.,"Sinularin, a natural product that purified from soft coral, exhibits anti-tumor effects against various human cancers. However, the mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we demonstrated that Sinularin inhibited the viability of human prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner and displayed significant cytotoxicity only at high concentration against normal prostate epithelial cell RWPE-1. Flow cytometry assay demonstrated that Sinularin induced tumor cell apoptosis. Further investigations revealed that Sinularin exerted anti-tumor activity through intrinsic apoptotic pathway along with up-regulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and PUMA, inhibition of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, mitochondrial membrane potential collapses, and release of mitochondrial proteins. Furthermore, we illustrated that Sinularin induced cell apoptosis via up-regulating PUMA through inhibition of FOXO3 degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. To explore how Sinularin suppress FOXO3 ubiquitin-proteasome degradation, we tested two important protein kinases AKT and ERK that regulate FOXO3 stabilization. The results revealed that Sinularin stabilized and up-regulated FOXO3 via inhibition of AKT- and ERK1/2-mediated FOXO3 phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. Our findings illustrated the potential mechanisms by which Sinularin induced cell apoptosis and Sinularin may be applied as a therapeutic agent for human prostate cancer.",2023,12,27
Upregulation of TRIM16 mitigates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by modulating TAK1 and YAP/Nrf2 pathways in mice.,"The clinic application of doxorubicin (DOX) is severely limited by its severe cardiotoxicity. Tripartite motif-containing protein 16 (TRIM16) has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and is upregulated in cardiomyocytes under pathological stress, yet its role in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity remains elusive. This study aims to investigate the role and mechanism of TRIM16 in DOX cardiotoxicity. Following TRIM16 overexpression in hearts with AAV9-TRIM16, mice were intravenously administered DOX at a dose of 4 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks to assess the impact of TRIM16 on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Transfection of OE-TRIM16 plasmids and siRNA-TRIM16 was performed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). Our results revealed that DOX challenge elicited a significant upregulation of TRIM16 proteins in cardiomyocytes. TRIM16 overexpression efficiently ameliorated cardiac function while suppressing inflammation, ROS generation, apoptosis and fibrosis provoked by DOX in the myocardium. TRIM16 knockdown exacerbated these alterations caused by DOX in NRCMs. Mechanistically, OE-TRIM16 augmented the ubiquitination and degradation of p-TAK1, thereby arresting JNK and p38MAPK activation evoked by DOX in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, DOX enhanced the interaction between p-TAK1 and YAP1 proteins, resulting in a reduction in YAP and Nrf2 proteins in cardiomyocytes. OE-TRIM16 elevated YAP levels and facilitated its nuclear translocation, thereby promoting Nrf2 expression and mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. This effect was nullified by siTRIM16 or TAK1 inhibitor Takinib. Collectively, the current study elaborates that upregulating TRIM16 mitigates DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress by modulating TAK1-mediated p38 and JNK as well as YAP/Nrf2 pathways, and targeting TRIM16 may provide a novel strategy to treat DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.",2023,12,26

Indirect reciprocity with abductive reasoning.,"Indirect reciprocity is a reputational mechanism through which cooperative behavior can be promoted amongst a group of individuals. However, in order for this mechanism to effectively do so, cheating must be appropriately punished and cooperating appropriately rewarded. Errors in assessments and actions can hinder this process. In such a setting, individuals might try to reason about evidence to assign reputations given the possibility of errors. Here, we consider a well-established theory of reasoning used to combine evidence, abductive reasoning, as a possible means by which such errors can be circumvented. Specifically, we use Dempster-Shafer theory to model individuals who account for possible errors by combining information about their beliefs about the status of the population and the errors rates and then choose the simplest scenario that could explain their observations in the context of these beliefs. We investigate the effectiveness of abductive reasoning at promoting cooperation for five social norms: Scoring, Shunning, Simple Standing, Staying, and Stern Judging. We find that, generally, abductive reasoning can outperform non-reasoning models at ameliorating the effects of the aforementioned challenges and promote higher levels of cooperation under low-error conditions. However, for high-error conditions, we find that abductive reasoning can undermine cooperation. Furthermore, we also find that a degree of bias towards believing previously held reputations can help sustain cooperation.",2023,12,26

Construction of chrysophanol loaded nanoparticles with N-octyl-O-sulfate chitosan for enhanced nephroprotective effect.,"Natural occurring anthraquinone like chrysophanol has been studied because of its anti-diabetic, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective and neuroprotective properties. Nonetheless, its poor water solubility and unstable nature are big concerns in achieving efficient delivery and associated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects. Herein, this study sought to solve the above-mentioned problem through development of chrysophanol-loaded nanoparticles to enhance the bioavailability of chrysophanol and to evaluate its anti-renal fibrosis effect in rats. After synthesis of a safe N-octyl-O-sulfate chitosan, we used it to prepare chrysophanol-loaded nanoparticles through dialysis technique before we performed and physical characterization. Also, we tested the stability of the nanoparticles for 21 days at 4 °C and room temperature (25 °C) and evaluated their pharmacokinetics and anti-renal fibrosis effect in rat model of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In terms of results, the nano-preparation demonstrated an acceptable narrow size distribution, wherein the encapsulation rate, size, polydispersed index (PDI) and electrokinetic potential at room temperature were respectively 83.41±0.89 %, 364.88±13.62 nm, 0.192±0.015 and 23.78±1.39 mV. During 21 days of storage, we observed that size of particles and electrokinetic potential altered slightly but the difference was statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). Also, in vitro release studies showed that the formulation reached 84.74 % at 24 h. Chrysophanol nanoparticles showed a 2.57-fold increase in bioavailability compared to unformulated chrysophanol. More importantly, chrysophanol nanoparticles demonstrated certain renal internalization properties and anti-renal fibrosis effects, which could ultimately result in reduced blood-urea nitrogen (BUN), kidney-injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and serum creatinine (SCr) levels in model rats. In conclusion, the prepared chrysophanol-loaded nanoparticles potentially increased bioavailability and enhanced nephroprotective effects of chrysophanol.",2023,12,27

Alleviation of Splenic Injury by CB001 after Low-Dose Irradiation Mediated by NLRP3/Caspase-1-BAX/Caspase-3 Axis.,"Low-dose radiation has been extensively employed in clinical practice, including tumor immunotherapy, chronic inflammation treatment and nidus screening. However, the damage on the spleen caused by low-dose radiation significantly increases the risk of late infection-related mortality, and there is currently no corresponding protective strategy. In the present study, a novel compound preparation named CB001 mainly constituted of Acanthopanax senticosus (AS) and Oldenlandia diffusa (OD) was developed to alleviate splenic injury caused by fractionated low-dose exposures. As our results show that, white pulp atrophy and the excessive apoptosis in spleen tissue induced by radiation exposure were significantly ameliorated by CB001. Mechanistically, BAX-caspase-3 signaling and nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich-repeat-containing family pyrin 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome signaling were demonstrated to be involved in the radio-protective activity of CB001 with the selective activators. Furthermore, the crosstalk between apoptosis signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in mediating the radio-protective activity of CB001 was clarified, in which the pro-apoptotic protein BAX but not the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 was found to be downstream of NLRP3. Our study demonstrated that the use of a novel drug product CB001 can potentially facilitate the alleviation of radiation-induced splenic injury for patients receiving medical imaging diagnosis or fractionated radiation therapy.",2023,12,29

Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis: Clinical Presentation and Management.,"Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) refers to a number of clinical syndromes resulting from the presence and local proliferation of <i>Aspergillus</i> organisms in the lungs of patients with chronic lung disease. CPA is more common than was realized two decades ago. Recognition remains poor, despite recent studies from many countries highlighting the high prevalence in at-risk populations. In low- and middle-income countries, CPA may be misdiagnosed and treated as tuberculosis (TB). In addition, CPA may develop following successful TB treatment. The coronavirus disease pandemic has resulted in significant disruption to provision of TB care, likely leading to more extensive lung damage, which could increase the risk for CPA.Although CPA refers to various syndromes, the classic presentation is that of chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis, which manifests as one or more progressive cavities with or without a fungal ball, accompanied by systemic and respiratory symptoms for at least 3 months. Diagnosis relies on <i>Aspergillus</i> immunoglobulin G in serum, as sputum culture lacks sensitivity. Differential diagnosis includes mycobacterial infection, bacterial lung abscess or necrotizing pneumonia, lung cancer, and endemic fungi.The aim of antifungal treatment in CPA is to improve symptoms and quality of life, and to halt progression, and possibly reverse radiological changes. Current recommendations suggest treatment for 6 months, although in practice many patients remain on long-term treatment. Improvement may manifest as weight gain and improvement of symptoms such as productive cough, hemoptysis, and fatigue. Surgical management should be considered in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, in significant hemoptysis, and when there is concern for lack of response to therapy. Itraconazole and voriconazole are the first-line azoles, with more experience now accumulating with posaconazole and isavuconazole. Side effects are frequent and careful monitoring including therapeutic drug monitoring is essential. Intravenous antifungals such as echinocandins and amphotericin B are used in cases of azole intolerance or resistance, which often develop on treatment. Relapse is seen after completion of antifungal therapy in around 20% of cases, mostly in bilateral, high-burden disease.Several research priorities have been identified, including characterization of immune defects and genetic variants linked to CPA, pathogenetic mechanisms of <i>Aspergillus</i> adaptation in the lung environment, the contribution of non-<i>fumigatus</i> <i>Aspergillus</i> species, and the role of new antifungal agents, immunotherapy, and combination therapy.",2023,12,28

"Rad2, Rad14 and Rad26 recover Metarhizium robertsii from solar UV damage through photoreactivation in vivo.","Rad2, Rad14 and Rad26 recover ultraviolet (UV) damage by nucleotide excision repair (NER) in budding yeast but their functions in filamentous fungi have not been elucidated. Here, we report mechanistically different anti-UV effects of nucleus-specific Rad2, Rad14 and Rad26 orthologs in Metarhizium robertsii, an insect-pathogenic fungus. The null mutants of rad2, rad14 and rad26 showed a decrease of ∼90% in conidial resistance to UVB irradiation. When conidia were impaired at a UVB dose of 0.15 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, they were photoreactivated (germinated) by only 6-13% through a 5-h light plus 19-h dark incubation, whereas 100%, 80% and 70% of the wild-type conidia were photoreactivated at 0.15, 0.3 and 0.4 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The dose-dependent photoreactivation rates were far greater than the corresponding 24-h dark reactivation rates and were largely enhanced by the overexpression (OE) of rad2, rad14 or rad26 in the wild-type strain. The OE strains exhibited markedly greater activities in photoreactivation of conidia inactivated at 0.5-0.7 J/cm<sup>2</sup> than did the wild-type strain. Confirmed interactions of Rad2, Rad14 and Rad26 with photolyase regulators and/or Rad1 or Rad10 suggest that each of these proteins could have evolved into a component of the photolyase regulator-cored protein complex to mediate photoreactivation. The interactions inhibited in the null mutants resulted in transcriptional abolishment or repression of those factors involved in the complex. In conclusion, the anti-UV effects of Rad2, Rad14 and Rad26 depend primarily on DNA photorepair-dependent photoreactivation in M. robertsii and mechanistically differ from those of yeast orthologs depending on NER.",2023,12,23

Micropollutants in biochar produced from sewage sludge: A systematic review on the impact of pyrolysis operating conditions.,"Biochar obtained from sewage sludge serves as a valuable soil amendment in agriculture, enhancing soil properties by increasing the nutrient content, cation exchange capacity, water retention, and oxygen transmission. However, its utilisation is hampered by the presence of micropollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Previous studies indicate that the type and amount of micropollutants can be significantly adjusted by selecting the right process parameters. This literature review provides an overview of how (1) pyrolysis temperature, (2) carrier gas flow and type, (3) heating rate, and (4) residence time affect the concentration of micropollutants in biochar produced from sewage sludge. The micropollutants targeted are those listed by the European Biochar Certificate (EBC) and by the International Biochar Institution (IBI), including PAHs, PCDD/Fs, PCBs and VOCs. In addition, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are also considered due to their presence in sewage sludge. The findings suggest that higher pyrolysis temperatures reduce micropollutant levels. Moreover, the injection of a carrier gas (N<sub>2</sub> or CO<sub>2</sub>) during the pyrolysis and cooling processes effectively lowers PAHs and PCDD/Fs, by reducing the contact of biochar with oxygen, which is crucial in mitigating micropollutants. Nevertheless, limited available data impedes an assessment of the impact of these parameters on PFAS in biochar. In addition, further research is essential to understand the effects of carrier gas type, heating rate, and residence time in order to determine the optimal pyrolysis process parameters for generating clean biochar.",2023,12,27

The synthetic ICCG exhibits the enzymatic activity and will be useful in establishing the corresponding mirror-image version of ICCG.",2023,12,21
We don't know what you did last summer. On the importance of transparent reporting of reaction time data pre-processing.,"In behavioral, cognitive, and social sciences, reaction time measures are an important source of information. However, analyses on reaction time data are affected by researchers' analytical choices and the order in which these choices are applied. The results of a systematic literature review, presented in this paper, revealed that the justification for and order in which analytical choices are conducted are rarely reported, leading to difficulty in reproducing results and interpreting mixed findings. To address this methodological shortcoming, we created a checklist on reporting reaction time pre-processing to make these decisions more explicit, improve transparency, and thus, promote best practices within the field. The importance of the pre-processing checklist was additionally supported by an expert consensus survey and a multiverse analysis. Consequently, we appeal for maximal transparency on all methods applied and offer a checklist to improve replicability and reproducibility of studies that use reaction time measures.",2023,12,08
Estimating the Costs of End-of-Life Care in Patients With Advanced Cancer From the Perspective of an Insurance Organization: A Cross-Sectional Study in Iran.,Cancers are significant medical conditions that contribute to the rising costs of healthcare systems and chronic diseases.

Pyrolysis temperature matters: Biochar-derived dissolved organic matter modulates aging behavior and biotoxicity of microplastics.,"Microplastics (MPs) have emerged as a novel and highly concerning contaminant that is ubiquitous in the aqueous environment. However, the aging of MPs induced by dissolved organic matter (DOM), especially biochar-derived dissolved organic matter (BDOM), and the biological toxicity after aging are not fully understood. In this study, the effects of biochar-derived BDOMs on the photoaging and biotoxicity of MPs were investigated at different pyrolysis temperatures using micro-scale polyethylene (PE) as an example. The results showed that the amount of ·OH generated by the BDOM/PE systems was related to the molecular composition and structure of BDOMs. High temperature BDOM7/9 with less lignin-like (34.33 % / 41.80 %) and more lipid (24.58 % / 19.88 %) content could produce more ·OH by itself, and its binding ability with PE was weaker due to its less hydrophobic components (SUVA260 = 0.10 / 0.11), which resulted in a weaker shading effect and less inhibition of the system, thus resulting in more ·OH production in the high temperature BDOM7/9/PE system. However, the involvement of BDOM, although favoring the long-term stable ·OH production of the system, did not significantly promote the photoaging of MPs. Furthermore, combined in vivo and in vitro biotoxicity studies of MPs showed that photoaging PE with the involvement of BDOM greatly improved systemic inflammation and tissue damage, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS, such as ·OH and -OH)-induced cell death. For example, the addition of BDOM5/PE-light reduced the cell death of human lung, liver, and kidney cells from 54.70 %, 69.39 %, and 48.35 % to 22.78 %, 33.13 %, and 25.83 %, respectively, compared to the PE-light group. The results of this study contribute to an in-depth understanding of the environmental behavior of BDOM and MPs systems.",2023,12,24

Effect of uniparental disomy in parentage testing.,"Uniparental disomy (UPD) is a rare type of chromosomal aberration that may hinder the analysis of kinship during forensic identification. Here, we investigated these genetic findings to avoid false exclusions during parentage testing. Thirty-nine fluorescently labeled, autosomal short tandem repeats (STR) were amplified in three cases, to detect parent-child relationships. Twenty-three fluorescently labeled Y-chromosome STRs were also employed. These were subjected to capillary electrophoresis. The parentage index was calculated by the bipartite or tripartite model. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays were performed to further investigate the genetic mechanisms. The conclusions supported the biological mother-child relationship in three cases. However, in all cases, the alleged father and child had three autosomal STR markers, constrained to a single chromosome, which did not conform to Mendelian inheritance rules. The genotyping of 23 Y-chromosome STRs did not reveal any violations of Mendelian law. The combination of STR profiling and SNP microarrays suggested that two children had maternal UPD of chromosome 7, whilst one had UPD of chromosome 2. After excluding the three incompatible loci, the conclusions supported the biological father-child relationship in all cases. The same results were obtained when parentage testing of trios was used. Uniparental disomy may complicate the judgment of kinship in parentage testing. The possibility of UPD should be considered when incompatible STR loci are found on the same chromosome. Genetic evidence obtained through additional molecular techniques can provide better interpretation of kinship in the presence of UPD and avoid false exclusions of biological relationships.",2023,12,22
Forensic-medical characteristics of penetrating wounds as manifestations of explosive trauma in the case of decomposed bodies examination.,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 caused a significant spike in the number of deaths from blast injury. The impossibility of evacuating the bodies of dead servicemen or civilians from the battlefield for a long time leads to the fact that forensic experts often have to deal with the examination of bodies in a state of decomposed changes. At the same time, the material and technical support of forensic medical institutions in different parts of Ukraine is heterogeneous: most experts do not have access to laboratory or instrumental research methods and can only rely on macroscopic research data. This article provides an overview of the cases of expert examination of cases of explosive trauma of decomposed bodies using macroscopic, microscopic, chemical and instrumental research, which indicates the high efficiency of their use for the purpose of solving expert questions of various nature. At the same time, the identified morphological characteristics of the damage are not purely specific and indicate the action of a blunt solid object with a limited contact surface, which had high kinetic energy and significant penetrating capacity.",2023,12,21
"Construction of a super large Stokes shift near-infrared fluorescent probe for detection and imaging of superoxide anion in living cells, zebrafish and mice.","As one of the major reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup>) is engaged in maintaining redox homeostasis in the cell microenvironment. To identify the pathological roles in related disorders caused by abnormal expression of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup>, it is of great significance to monitor and track the fluctuation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> concentration in vivo. However, the low concentration of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> and the interference caused by tissue autofluorescence make the development of an ideal detection methodology full of challenges. Herein, a ""Turn-On"" chemical response near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probe Dcm-Cu-OTf for O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> detection in inflamed models, was constructed by conjugating the NIR fluorophore (dicyanisophorone derivative) with an O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> sensing moiety (trifluoromethanesulfonate). Dcm-Cu-OTf exerted about 140-fold fluorescence enhancement after reacting 200 μM O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> with an excellent limited of detection (LOD) as low as 149 nM. Additionally, Dcm-Cu-OTf exhibited a super large Stokes shift (260 nm) and high selectivity over other bio-analytes in stimulated conditions. Importantly, Dcm-Cu-OTf showed low toxicity and enabled imaging of the generation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> in the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated HeLa cells, zebrafish, and LPS-induced inflamed mice. The present study provided a potential and reliable detection tool to inspect the physiological and pathological progress of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> in living biosystems.",2023,12,23
Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia detection and duct pathology grading using FT-IR imaging and machine learning.,"Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) is manifested by noninvasive lesions in the epithelium of smaller pancreatic ducts. Generally, cancer development risk from low-grade PanIN is minor, whereas, invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development is highly related to high-grade PanINs. Therefore, in the case of high-grade PanIN detection, additional surgical resection may be recommended. However, even the low-grade PanINs can indicate possible progression to PDAC. The definition of PanIN is constantly changing and there is a need for new tools to better characterize and understand its behavior. We have recently developed a comprehensive pancreatic cancer classification model with biopsies collected from over 600 biopsies from 250 patients. Here, we take the next step and employ Infrared (IR) spectroscopy to build the first classification model for PanINs detection. Furthermore, we created a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) model to characterize ducts from benign to cancerous. This model was then used to predict and grade PanINs accordingly to their malignancy level.",2023,12,14
Study on the toxicity prediction model ofacetolactate synthase inhibitor herbicides based on human serum albumin and superoxide dismutase binding information.,"Toxicity significantly influences the successful development of drugs. Based on the toxicity prediction method (carrier protein binding information-toxicity relationship) previously established by the our group, this paper introduces information on the interaction between pesticides and environmental markers (SOD) into the model for the first time, so that the toxicity prediction model can not only predict the toxicity of pesticides to humans and animals, but also predict the toxicity of pesticides to the environment. Firstly, the interaction of acetolactate synthase inhibitor herbicides (ALS inhibitor herbicides) with human serum albumin (HSA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was investigated systematically from theory combined with experiments by spectroscopy methods and molecular docking, and important fluorescence parameters were obtained. Then, the fluorescence parameters, pesticides acute toxicity LD<sub>50</sub> and structural splitting information were used to construct predictive modeling of ALS inhibitor herbicides based on the carrier protein binding information (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.977) and the predictive modeling of drug acute toxicity based on carrier protein binding information and conformational relationship (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.991), which had effectively predicted pesticides toxicity in humans and animals. To predict potential environmental toxicity, the predictive modeling of drug acute toxicity based on superoxide dismutase binding information was established (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.883) by ALS inhibitor herbicides-SOD binding information, which has a good predictive ability in the potential toxicity of pesticides to the environment. This study lays the foundation for developing low toxicity pesticides.",2023,12,16
Biomimetic SERS substrate with silicon-mediated internal standard: Improved sensing of environmental pollutants and nutrients.,"Biomimetic materials with fascinating natural micro-nano surface structures offer a good choice for the simple fabrication of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate. This study presented a novel sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC)-Ag biomimetic substrate which was fabricated through the reverse replication of micro-nano structures from cantaloupe peel. Particularly, silicon nanoparticles (Si NPs) were doped into this flexible biomimetic substrate in its fabrication process. Abundant electromagnetic ""hotspots"" could be effectively excited in this Ag densely covered matrix which maintained numerous protrusions as well as vertical and horizontal grooves. Specifically, the doped Si NPs exhibited a robust intrinsic Raman peak, which could be employed as an internal standard to calibrate the target signal. In this regard, the biomimetic substrate with the optimal electromagnetic enhancement and the quantitative calibration capabilities exhibited a high enhancement factor and a remedied linear relationship in the detection. After a perfect uniformity of signal was proved by the corrected SERS mapping, the biomimetic SERS substrate was finally utilized in the practical analysis of methylene blue (MB) and β-carotene with ultra-low limit of detection, highlighting its importance in practical detection scenarios.",2023,12,24
Root phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity is essential for Sorghum bicolor tolerance to ammonium nutrition.,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC; EC 4.1.1.31) is an enzyme family with pivotal roles in plant carbon and nitrogen metabolism. A main role for non-photosynthetic PEPC is as anaplerotic enzyme to load tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle with carbon skeletons that compensate the intermediates diverted for biomolecule synthesis such as amino acids. When plants are grown under ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) nutrition, the excessive uptake of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> often provokes a stress situation. When plants face NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress, N assimilation is greatly induced and thus, requires the supply of carbon skeletons coming from TCA cycle. In this work, we addressed the importance of root PEPC and TCA cycle for sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench), a C4 cereal crop, grown under ammonium nutrition. To do so, we used RNAi sorghum lines that display a decrease expression of SbPPC3 (Ppc3 lines), the main root PEPC isoform, and reduced root PEPC activity. SbPPC3 silencing provoked ammonium hypersensitivity, meaning lower biomass accumulation in Ppc3 respect to WT plants when growing under ammonium nutrition. The silenced plants presented a deregulation of primary metabolism as highlighted by the accumulation of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in the root and the alteration of normal TCA functioning, which was evidenced by the accumulation of organic acids in the root under ammonium nutrition. Altogether, our work evidences the importance of non-photosynthetic PEPC, and root TCA cycle, in sorghum to deal with high external NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> availability.",2023,12,25
The molecular paradigm of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) with different phytohormone signaling pathways during drought stress in plants.,"Drought is undoubtedly a major environmental constraint that negatively affects agricultural yield and productivity throughout the globe. Plants are extremely vulnerable to drought which imposes several physiological, biochemical and molecular perturbations. Increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in different plant organs is one of the inevitable consequences of drought. ROS and RNS are toxic byproducts of metabolic reactions and poise oxidative stress and nitrosative stress that are detrimental for plants. In spite of toxic effects, these potentially active radicals also play a beneficial role in mediating several signal transduction events that lead to plant acclimation and enhanced survival under harsh environmental conditions. The precise understanding of ROS and RNS signaling and their molecular paradigm with different phytohormones, such as auxin, gibberellin, cytokinin, abscisic acid, ethylene, brassinosteroids, strigolactones, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and melatonin play a pivotal role for maintaining plant fitness and resilience to counteract drought toxicity. Therefore, the present review provides an overview of integrated systemic signaling between ROS, RNS and phytohormones during drought stress based on past and recent advancements and their influential role in conferring protection against drought-induced damages in different plant species.

Characterization of lamb shashliks with different roasting methods by intelligent sensory technologies and GC-MS to simulate human muti-sensation: Based on multimodal deep learning.,"To simulate the functions of olfaction, gustation, vision, and oral touch, intelligent sensory technologies have been developed. Headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS) with electronic noses (E-noses), electronic tongues (E-tongues), computer vision (CVs), and texture analyzers (TAs) was applied for sensory characterization of lamb shashliks (LSs) with various roasting methods. A total of 56 VOCs in lamb shashliks with five roasting methods were identified by HS-SPME/GC-MS, and 21 VOCs were identified as key compounds based on OAV (>1). Cross-channel sensory Transformer (CCST) was also proposed and used to predict 19 sensory attributes and their lamb shashlik scores with different roasting methods. The model achieved satisfactory results in the prediction set (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.964). This study shows that a multimodal deep learning model can be used to simulate assessor, and it is feasible to guide and correct sensory evaluation.",2023,12,24
Graphene-based biosensors in milk analysis: A review of recent developments.,"Cow's milk, an excellent source of fat, protein, amino acids, vitamins and minerals, is currently one of the most consumed products worldwide. Contaminations originating from diverse sources, such as biological, chemical, and physical, cause dairy product quality problems and thus dairy-related disorders, raising public health issues. For this reason, legal authorities have deemed it necessary to classify certain contaminations in commercial milk and keep them within particular limitations; therefore, it is urgent to develop next-generation detection systems that can accurately identify just the contaminants of concern to human health. This review presents a detailed investigation of biosensors based on graphene and its derivatives, which offer superior sensitivity and selectivity, by classifying the contaminants under the headings biological, chemical, and physical, in cow's milk according to their sources. We reviewed the current status of graphene-based biosensor (GBs) technology for milk or dairy analysis, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses with the help of comparative studies, tables, and charts, and we put forward a novel perspective to handle future challenges.",2023,12,24
From fringe to mainstream: The Garcia effect.,"The rejection of research results is sometimes thought to be justified in cases of individuals embracing fringe ideas that depart significantly from prevailing orthodoxy, or in cases of individuals who lack appropriate expertise or credentials. The case of John Garcia exhibits both of these dimensions, and illustrates that such rejection can delay scientific advancements. Garcia's work decisively challenged what was the orthodoxy in psychology in the midcentury: behaviorism. Behaviorist learning theorists suffered from theory-entrenchment insofar as they failed to acknowledge Garcia's anomalous research findings that ran counter to their theoretical expectations. The case study also illustrates that theories on the margins can become embraced as a result of advancements in adjacent research fields. Studying how Garcia's work moved from fringe to mainstream results in lessons for the philosophy of science and epistemology more generally. Only when we see the mechanisms of exclusion at work can we understand how science and other knowledge production systems can inadvertently act counterproductively via gatekeeping practices that filter out unorthodox points of view.",2023,12,27
The multiple arrays of a PD1-derived peptide on chromatin specifically bind to PD-L1 and induce doxorubicin resistance in cancer cell lines.,"Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand 1 (PD-L1) have been extensively studied to block the activation of the PD-1 axis immune checkpoint pathway on T cells. However, recent evidence suggests that PD-1-independent PD-L1 pathways in cancer cells and macrophages are important in cellular proliferation and survival of those cell types but the underlying mechanism is little understood. To recapitulate the binding of multiple PD-1 to the high levels of PD-L1 expression on cancer cell membranes, recombinant histones carrying a PD-1 receptor-derived peptide (PDR) were prepared and used to assemble a PDR-displayed nucleosome array. PDR-displayed chromatin showed physiologically spaced nucleosomes, unaffected by N-terminal histone tails and biotinylated DNA modifications. PDR-displayed chromatin exhibited selective binding to the breast cancer cell line with high PD-L1 expression, MDA-MB-231, where saturated binding occurred within 3 h, comparable to well-known antigen-antibody reactions. Notably, PDR-displayed chromatin enhanced resistance to doxorubicin in PD-L1-overexpressed cancer cells, revealing a PD-L1 level-dependent effect on cell survival upon chemotherapy. Our study sheds light on the potential of PDR-displayed chromatin as a tool to induce chemoresistance in cancer cells without employing anti-PD-L1 antibodies or soluble PD-1 receptors. Further investigation into the underlying signaling pathways and therapeutic applications is warranted, positioning PDR-displayed chromatin as a valuable tool for understanding PD-L1-mediated intracellular signaling pathways in cancer cells with high PD-L1 expression.",2023,12,22
Mechanical effects modulate drug resistance in MCF-7-derived organoids: Insights into the wnt/β-catenin pathway.,"Addressing drug resistance poses a significant challenge in cancer treatment, as cancer cells develop diverse mechanisms to evade chemotherapy drugs, leading to treatment failure and disease relapse. Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture has emerged as a valuable model for studying drug resistance, although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. By obtaining a better understanding of drug resistance within the 3D culture environment, we can develop more effective strategies to overcome it and improve the success of cancer treatments. Notably, the physical structure undergoes notable changes in 3D culture, with mechanical effects believed to play a pivotal role in drug resistance. Hence, our study aimed to explore the influence of mechanical effects on drug resistance by analyzing data related to ""drug resistance"" and ""mechanobiology"". Through this analysis, we identified β-catenin and JNK1 as potential factors, which were further examined in MCF-7 cells cultivated under both 2D and 3D culture conditions. Our findings demonstrate that β-catenin is activated through canonical and non-canonical pathways and associated with the drug resistance, particularly in organoids obtained under 3D culture.",2023,12,21
Theoretical computation of the band broadening in micro-pillar array columns.,"We have investigated the possibility to establish a theoretical plate height expression for the band broadening in the most widely used micro-pillar array column format, i.e., a cylindrical pillar array wherein the pillar walls and the channel bottom are coated with a thin layer of meso‑porous material. Assuming isotropic diffusion in the shell-layer, it was found that the vertical diffusive transport along the porous shell-layer covering the pillar walls significantly suppresses the band broadening originating from the vertical migration velocity gradients. As the vertical transport in the shell-layer increases linearly with the retention equilibrium constant K, this leads to an anomalous dependency on the retention factor. Indeed, instead of increasing with k'' and following the classic (1+ak''+bk''<sup>2</sup>)/(1 + k'')<sup>2</sup>-dependency governing a classic Taylor-Aris system, the variation of the mobile zone mass transfer resistance term h<sub>Cm</sub> in a 3D pillar array with bottom-wall retention goes through a maximum (resp. factor 1.5 (k''=4) and 2 (k''=16) difference between observed and classic Taylor-Aris behaviour). This effect increases with increasing pillar heights and increasing reduced velocities. Because of this complex k''-dependency, it proves very cumbersome to establish a general plate height equation covering all conditions. Instead, a plate height expression was established that is limited up to k''=4, but remains accurate for higher k''-values for cases where the ratio of pillar height over inter-pillar distance remains below 5. It can however be anticipated the proposed analytical model is only valid in a rather limited range around the presently considered external porosity of ε=0.5.",2023,12,24
Simultaneous occurrence of multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia: Case report and literature review.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are malignant clonal diseases of cells in different lineages. It remains very rare to have both diseases at first diagnosis. Only 24 cases of this situation were reported from 1971 to 2021, and poor prognosis in most cases. However, here we describe a case of de novo MM and AML occurring simultaneously in a 65-year-old woman. We have successfully used individualized treatment regimens to allow the patient to survive 1.5 years to date, which has exceeded 80 % of statistical cases.",2023,12,23
The feasibility of workload monitoring among law enforcement officers: A multi-methodological approach.,"This study examined the feasibility of workload monitoring to assess internal workload in law enforcement officers (LEO) using a multi-methodological approach. Fifty front-line LEO completed workload surveys on workdays for eight weeks. Retention and adherence were assessed across the survey period. LEO completed usability and likelihood to continue questionnaires, while departmental administrators (n = 8) received workload reports and completed utility and sustainability questionnaires. A subsample of LEO and administrators participated in semi-structured interviews, following consensual qualitative research design. LEO retention (96%), survey adherence (94%), and usability scores (88.3/100) were high, with a moderate likelihood to continue to use the survey. Administration reported high utility and sustainability. The high adherence rates and usability scores, coupled with strong administrative support, suggest that workload monitoring may be a feasible strategy among LEO to monitor occupational workloads. The LEO and administration feedback highlight areas of improvement (e.g., data transparency, departmental collaboration) to inform future implementation.",2023,12,27

Effective removal of As from a high arsenic-bearing ZnSO<sub>4</sub> solution by ultrasonic enhanced ozonation in a one-pot method.,"Currently, removing arsenic (As) from ZnSO<sub>4</sub> solution using lime presents several drawbacks, including high wet precipitate content, long reaction time, and the introduction of new impurities. In this study, we propose a novel ultrasonic (US) ozone one-pot method for effectively removing As from a high-arsenic ZnSO<sub>4</sub> solution. In this method, as in ZnSO4 solution was removed by ultrasound enhanced ozone oxidation combined with zinc roasting dust (ZRD). No secondary pollution will occur with the addition of ZRD and ozone, as neither introduces new impurities. The experimental results show that under the conditions of initial As and Fe concentrations of 1640 mg/L and 2963 mg/L, US power of 480 W, frequency of 20 kHz, reaction temperature of 60 °C, reaction time of 1 h, ZRD dose of 12 g/L and gas flow rate of 900 mL/min, the removal rate of As can reach 99.4%. The introduction of US can further enhance the oxidation effect of ozone on As(III) and Fe<sup>2+</sup> by increasing the solubility of ozone and promoting the production of OH radicals. Additionally, US cavitation and mechanical action increase the probability of contact between various reactants in the solution, facilitating the occurrence of reactions. US also reduces the aggregation of arsenic-containing precipitates and the encapsulation of ZRD by arsenic containing precipitates, thereby decreasing the amount of arsenic-containing precipitates. In comparison to the traditional lime method, this approach results in a significant reduction in the amount of arsenic-containing precipitate by 54.5% and a 60% decrease in the total reaction time. The As removal mechanism of our method encompasses ZRD neutralization, US-enhanced ozone mass transfer and decomposition, oxidation of As(III) and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and adsorption and coprecipitation. Consequently, the proposed method provides a cost-effective, fast, safe and environmentally friendly alternative for treating arsenic-contaminated ZnSO<sub>4</sub> solutions.",2023,12,26
Distributionally sensitive measurement and valuation of population health.,"We introduce a measure of population health that is sensitive to inequality in both age-specific health and lifespan and can be calculated from a health-extended period life table. By allowing for inequality aversion, the measure generalises health-adjusted life expectancy without requiring more data. A transformation of change in the (life-years) measure gives a distributionally sensitive monetary valuation of change in population health and disease burden. Application to Sub-Saharan Africa between 1990 and 2019 reveals that the change in population health is sensitive to allowing for lifespan inequality but is less sensitive to age-specific health inequality. Allowing for distributional sensitivity changes relative burdens of diseases, reduces convergence between the burdens of communicable and non-communicable diseases, and so could influence disease prioritisation. It increases the value of health improvements relative to GDP.",2023,12,15
A practical online prediction platform to predict the survival status of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma after 5 years.,"Currently, there are few practical tools for predicting the prognosis of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC).

Transcriptome analysis reveals dysfunction of the endoplasmic reticulum protein processing in the sonic muscle of small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) following noise exposure.,"Noise pollution is increasingly prevalent in aquatic ecosystems, causing detrimental effects on growth and behavior of marine fishes. The physiological responses of fish to underwater noise are poorly understood. In this study, we used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to study the transcriptome of the sonic muscle in small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) after exposure to a 120 dB noise for 30 min. The behavioral experiment revealed that noise exposure resulted in accelerated tail swimming behavior at the beginning of the exposure period, followed by loss of balance at the end of experiment. Transcriptomic analysis found that most highly expressed genes in the sonic muscle, including parvalbumin, slc25a4, and troponin C were related with energy metabolism and locomotor function. Further, a total of 1261 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 284 up-regulated and 977 down-regulated genes in the noise exposure group compared with the control group. Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the most enriched categories of DEGs included protein folding and response to unfolding protein. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis found over-represented pathways including protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, chaperones and folding catalysts, as well as arginine and proline metabolism. Specifically, many genes related to fatty acid and collagen metabolism were up-regulated in the noise exposure group. Taken together, our results indicate that exposure to noise stressors alters the swimming behavior of croaker, inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress, disrupting lipid metabolism, and causing collagen degradation in the sonic muscle of L. polyactis.",2023,12,14
Iron and aluminum ore mining pollution induce oxidative and tissue damage on fruit-eating bats from the Atlantic Forest.,"Mining, a vital industry for economic growth, poses significant environmental pollution challenges. Failures in tailings dam containment have caused environmental contamination and raised concerns about preserving the globally significant biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest, which is under severe threat. Fruit-eating bats are key for forest regeneration as essential seed dispersers and pollinators. This study focuses on two keystone species, Artibeus lituratus and Sturnira lilium, exploring the effects of iron ore mining area (FEOA) and aluminum ore mining area (ALOA) on these bats, respectively, and comparing to individuals from a preserved Atlantic Forest fragment (FFA). Bats from FEOA showed higher Aluminum (Al), Calcium (Ca), Iron (Fe) and Barium (Ba) liver accumulation, as well as Ca and Fe muscle accumulation. These animals also showed higher liver and kidney oxidative damage associated with liver fibrosis and kidney inflammation. Brain and muscle also showed oxidative stress. Bats from ALOA showed higher Ca and Ba liver accumulation and Ca, Zinc (Zn), and Ba muscle accumulation, along with higher brain oxidative stress, liver fibrosis, and kidney inflammation. Our findings indicate that iron and aluminum ore mining activities cause adverse effects on bat tissues, posing a potential threat to biodiversity maintenance in the Atlantic Forest.",2023,12,17
Quantitative characterization of resident' exposure to typical semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) around a non-ferrous metal smelting plant.,"To comprehensively characterize residents' exposure to major semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), samples of indoor floor wipes, size-segregated airborne particles, gaseous air, food, and paired skin wipes were simultaneously collected from residential areas around a large non-ferrous metal smelting plant as compared with the control areas, and three typical SVOCs (including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and halogenated PAHs (HPAHs)) were determined. Comparison and correlation analysis among matrices indicated PAHs were the major contaminants emitted from metal smelting activities compared to HPAHs and PCBs, with naphthalene verified as the most important characteristic compound, and their accumulation on skin may be a comprehensive consequence of contact with floor dust and air. While patterns of human exposure pathways for the SVOCs were found to be clearly correlated to their vapor pressure, dermal absorption was the major contributor (51.1-76.3%) to total carcinogenic risk (TCR) of PAHs and HPAHs for surrounding residents, especially for low molecular weight PAHs, but dietary ingestion (98.6%) was the dominant exposure pathway to PCBs. The TCR of PAHs exceeded the acceptable level (1 × 10<sup>-4</sup>), implying smelting activities obviously elevated the health risk. This study will serve developing pertinent exposure and health risk prevention measures.",2023,12,25
Combined effects of nanoplastics and elevated temperature in the freshwater water flea Daphnia magna.,"Global warming and nanoplastics (NPs) are critical global issues. Among NPs, one of the most hazardous types of plastics, polystyrene (PS), poses ecotoxicological threats to several freshwater organisms. The degree of toxicity of PS-NPs is strongly influenced by various environmental factors. This study illustrates the combined effects of temperature and PS-NPs on the water flea Daphnia magna. The sensitivity of D. magna to PS-NPs was tested under control (23 °C) and elevated temperatures (28 °C). As a result, increased temperatures influenced the uptake and accumulation of PS-NPs. Co-exposure to both higher temperatures and PS-NPs resulted in a drastic decrease in reproductive performance. The level of oxidative stress was found to have increased in a temperature-dependent manner. Oxidative stress was stimulated by both stressors, leading to increased levels of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant enzyme activity supported by upregulation of antioxidant enzyme-related genes under combined PS-NPs exposure and elevated temperature. In the imbalanced status of intracellular redox, activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway was induced by exposure to PS-NPs at high temperatures, which supported the decline of the reproductive capacity of D. magna. Therefore, our results suggest that PS-NPs exposure along with an increase in temperature significantly affects physiological processes triggered by damage from oxidative stress, leading to severely inhibited reproduction of D. magna.",2023,12,21
Near-field exposures and human health impacts for organic chemicals in interior paints: A high-throughput screening.,"Interior paints contain organic chemicals that might be harmful to painters and building residents. This study aims to develop a high-throughput approach to screen near-field human exposures and health impacts related to organic chemicals in interior paints. We developed mass balance models for both water- and solvent-based paints, predicting emissions during wet and dry phases. We then screened exposures and risks, focusing on Sri Lanka where residential houses are frequently repainted. These models accurately predict paint drying time and indoor air concentrations of organic chemicals. Exposures of both painter and household resident were estimated for 65 organic chemicals in water-based and 26 in solvent-based paints, considering 12 solvents. Chemicals of concerns (CoCs) were identified, and maximum acceptable chemical contents (MACs) were calculated. Water-based paints generally pose lower health risks than solvent-based paints but might contain biocides of high concern. The total human health impact of one painting event on all household adults ranges from 1.5 × 10<sup>-3</sup> to 2.1 × 10<sup>-2</sup> DALYs for solvent-based paints, and from 4.1 × 10<sup>-4</sup> to 9.5 × 10<sup>-3</sup> DALYs for water-based paints. The present approach is a promising way to support the formulation of safer paint, and is integrated in the USEtox scientific consensus model for use in life cycle assessment, chemical substitution and risk screening.",2023,12,12
Regenerative braking system effectively reduces the formation of brake wear particles.,"Brake wear particles (BWPs) are considered one of the most significant non-exhaust particle emission sources from motor vehicles. Previous studies have primarily focused on BWPs from conventional fuel vehicles (CFVs), with limited research available on BWPs from new energy vehicles (NEVs). We developed an independent BWP emission testing system applicable to NEVs and conducted BWP emission tests on representative NEVs and CFVs under various testing cycles via a chassis dynamometer. The BWP emission characteristics of the NEVs equipped with regenerative braking system significantly differed from those of gasoline vehicles. For transient emission characteristics, gasoline vehicles exhibited higher peak concentrations during brake events than brake drag events, while those with regenerative braking exhibited the opposite feature. Under continuous braking, the concentration of ultrafine particles emitted by NEVs was reduced by more than 3 orders of magnitude compared to gasoline vehicles. In terms of single-particle morphology, BWPs could be mainly divided into three categories: carbonaceous particles, iron-rich particles, and mixed metal particles. We obtained realistic emission characteristics of BWPs from NEVs, which could provide data support and a scientific basis for the formulation of relevant emission standards and control measures in the future.",2023,12,23
"Characteristics and catalytic mechanism of a novel multifunctional oxidase, CpmO, for chloramphenicols degradation from Sphingobium sp. WTD-1.","Chloramphenicols (CAPs) are ubiquitous emerging pollutants that threaten ecological environments and human health. Microbial and enzyme-based biodegradation strategies offer a cost-effective environmentally friendly approach for CAPs removal from contaminated sites. Here, CpmO, a novel multifunctional oxidase for CAP degradation was identified from the CAP-degrading strain Sphingobium sp. WTD-1. This enzyme was found to be responsible for both the oxidation of the C3-hydroxyl and oxidative cleavage of the C1-C2 bond of CAP, and the oxidative cleavage pathway of CAP was dominant. The catalytic efficiency of CpmO for CAP was 41.6 times that for thiamphenicol (TAP) under the optimal conditions (40 °C, pH 6.0). CpmO was identified as a member of the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis analysis indicated that CAP was connected to the key amino acid residues E231/E395, K277, and I273/A276 in CpmO through hydrogen bonding, nonclassical hydrogen bonding, and π-π stacking forces, respectively. The catalytic activities of the A276W, K277P, and E231S mutants were found to be 1.1 times, 6.4 times, and 13.2 times higher than that of the wild type, respectively. These findings provide genetic resources and theoretical guidance for future application in biotechnological and metabolic engineering efforts for the remediation of CAPs-contaminated environments.",2023,12,22
From the closet to the shore: Fashion waste pollution on Colombian Central Caribbean beaches.,"This paper examines the environmental effects of fashion waste on the central Caribbean coast of Colombia, highlighting significant ecological issues in coastal areas. A survey of 27 beaches found 503 items of fashion waste, mainly shoes and sandals, with an average density of 0.93 items/m<sup>2</sup>. The distribution of this type of waste varies notably across different beach types, with exposed, rural, and remote beaches showing higher accumulation, indicating a relationship between beach characteristics and waste concentration. Primary sources of this waste include riverine transport, coastal tourism, and poorly managed sewage systems, impacting urban, rural, and village beaches differently. The study reveals that longshore currents and oceanic movements, significantly influence the transport and fate of this waste, with exposed beaches accumulating more fashion waste than sheltered ones. The presence of driftwood also plays a vital role in trapping fashion waste along coastlines. The findings highlight the need for effective management strategies to mitigate the impact of fashion waste, providing crucial insights for local and national coastal managers and implications for managing fashion waste in the Southern Caribbean and similar regions worldwide.",2023,12,27
Bioaccumulation of PAHs in marine bivalves of the Santos Estuary (Brazil) associated with the evaluation of human consumption.,"The present study aimed to evaluate concentrations of 16 priority PAHs in the mussel Perna perna and oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae of the Santos Estuary (Brazil) and the potential risk to human health associated with the consumption of these species. The levels of ΣPAHs in the tissues of bivalves ranged from 96.94 to 988.76 μg/kg for mussels and from 88.38 to 138.62 μg/kg for oysters. A general trend of higher concentrations of PAHs was observed according to the increase in log K<sub>ow</sub> values in both species. The estimated amount of ΣPAHs via mussel and oyster intake ranged from 1.0 to 3.2 ng/kg and from 0.4 to 1.2 ng/kg of body weight per day, respectively. The calculated THQs, HI and CRs for the regular consumption of raw bivalves followed the internationally acceptable limits and represent a low risk to human health.",2023,12,27
"Heavy metal concentrations in sharks, rays and chimaeras from the western Mediterranean Sea.","The potential bioaccumulation of pollutants, such as heavy metals, may pose a threat to the western Mediterranean chondrichthyans and human consumers. Therefore, the first extensive assessment of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and copper (Cu) concentrations in the muscle tissue of 17 species of sharks, rays, and chimaeras in this region was conducted via Microwave Assisted Extraction (MAE) and Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GFAAS). Significant differences between species were observed, particularly related to the rabbit fish (Chimaera monstrosa) and the velvet belly lantern shark (Etmopterus spinax), which exceeded the European Union (EU) Commission Regulation 2023/915 threshold of Cd. Overall, heavy metal concentrations correlated negatively with size and trophic level but positively with depth. Although the consumption of these species may entail minimal risk to adult humans, caution is advised, especially for children. These findings are important due to the widespread consumption of chondrichthyans in many western Mediterranean regions.",2023,12,27
"Spatial distribution, source identification, and transportation paths of plutonium in the Beibu Gulf, South China Sea.","To investigate the spatial distribution and source of plutonium isotopes in the Beibu Gulf, surface sediments were collected and analyzed using sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS). The activities of <sup>239+240</sup>Pu in surface sediments ranged from 0.012 to 0.451 mBq/g (mean: 0.171 ± 0.138 mBq/g, n = 36), indicating a decreasing trend in a counterclockwise direction from the southern bay mouth. The counterclockwise decreasing trend in the south of the bay mouth is similar to the current in the Beibu Gulf. The <sup>240</sup>Pu/<sup>239</sup>Pu atom ratios in surface sediments ranged from 0.156 to 0.283 (mean: 0.236 ± 0.031, n = 36), slightly higher than that of the global fallout value of 0.18. This suggests that the Pu in the Beibu Gulf was a combination of global fallout and Pacific Proving Ground (PPG). The average contribution of the plutonium (Pu) derived from the PPG in the sediment was estimated to be 52 % ± 24 %.",2023,12,27
Innovative approach for predicting biogas production from large-scale anaerobic digester using long-short term memory (LSTM) coupled with genetic algorithm (GA).,"An artificial neural network (ANN) model called long-short term memory (LSTM), coupled with a genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection, was used to predict biogas production of large-scale anaerobic digesters (ADs) of Tehran South Wastewater Treatment Plant (Iran), with a biogas production of approximately 30,000 Nm<sup>3</sup>/d. In order to employ the real conditions, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the ADs (21 days) was considered as the LSTM look-back window. To evaluate the model predictions, three different scenarios were defined. In the first scenario, the model predicted the produced biogas by using raw wastewater characteristics and reached the coefficient of determination of R<sup>2</sup> = 0.84. The GA selected four out of eleven parameters of raw wastewater, including loads of BOD<sub>5</sub>, COD, TSS, and TN (kg/d), as the most informative data for the model. In the second scenario, the model predicted the produced biogas by employing the data of the thickened sludge streams entering the ADs and yielded a higher accuracy (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.89). In this scenario, GA selected two out of six parameters of the sludge streams, including total flow rate (m<sup>3</sup>/d) and average solids content (w/w%). Finally, in the third scenario, by putting the parameters of the two previous scenarios together, the model's prediction accuracy increased slightly (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.90). The results demonstrated that the GA-LSTM modeling technique could achieve reliable performance in predicting biogas production of large-scale ADs by including HRT in modeling procedure. It was also found that the raw wastewater characteristics severely affect AD behavior and can be successfully used as the input data of the AD models.",2023,12,26
Health-aware food recommendation system with dual attention in heterogeneous graphs.,"Recommender systems (RS) have been increasingly applied to food and health. However, challenges still remain, including the effective incorporation of heterogeneous information and the discovery of meaningful relationships among entities in the context of food and health recommendations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, the Health-aware Food Recommendation System with Dual Attention in Heterogeneous Graphs (HFRS-DA), for unsupervised representation learning on heterogeneous graph-structured data. HFRS-DA utilizes an attention technique to reconstruct node features and edges and employs a dual hierarchical attention mechanism for enhanced unsupervised learning of attributed graph representations. HFRS-DA addresses the challenge of effectively leveraging the heterogeneous information in the graph and discovering meaningful semantic relationships between entities. The framework analyses recipe components and their neighbours in the heterogeneous graph and can discover popular and healthy recipes, thereby promoting healthy eating habits. We compare HFRS-DA using the Allrecipes dataset and find that it outperforms all the related methods from the literature. Our study demonstrates that HFRS-DA enhances the unsupervised learning of attributed graph representations, which is important in scenarios where labelled data is scarce or unavailable. HFRS-DA can generate node embeddings for unused data effectively, enabling both inductive and transductive learning.",2023,12,23
Computer vision-aided mmWave communications for indoor medical healthcare.,"Comprehensive and exceedingly precise centralized patient monitoring has become essential to advance predictive, preventive, and efficient patient care in contemporary healthcare. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology, boasting high-frequency and high-speed wireless communication, holds promise as a viable solution to this challenge. This paper presents a new approach that combines mmWave communication and computer vision (CV) to achieve real-time patient monitoring and data transmission in indoor medical environments. The system comprises a transmitter, a reflective surface, and multiple communication targets, and utilizes the high-frequency, low-latency features of mmWave as well as CV-based target detection and depth estimation for precise localization and reliable data transmission. A machine learning algorithm analyses real-time images captured by an optical camera to identify target distance and direction and establish clear line-of-sight links. The system proactively adapts its transmission power and channel allocation based on the target's movements, guaranteeing complete coverage, even in potentially obstructive areas. This methodology tackles the escalating demand for high-speed, real-time data processing in modern healthcare, significantly enhancing its delivery.",2023,12,19

Water-Induced Expanded Bilayer Vascular Graft with Good Hemocompatibility and Biocompatibility.,"Shape memory polymer (SMP) vascular grafts are promising interventional vascular grafts for cardiovascular disease (CAD) treatment; However, hemocompatibility and biocompatibility, which are the critical issues for the SMP vascular grafts, are not systematically concerned. Furthermore, the water-induced SMP grafts are more convenient and safer than the thermally induced ones in case of the bioapplication. Herein, in this work, the new water-induced expanded bilayer vascular graft with the inner layer of crosslinked poly(ε-caprolactone) (cPCL) and the outer layer of water-induced SMP of regenerated chitosan/polyvinyl alcohol (RCS/PVA) are prepared by hot pressing and programming approaches. The results show that the inner and outer layer surfaces of the prepared grafts are smooth, and they exhibit good interfacial interaction properties. The bilayer grafts show good mechanical properties and can be expanded in water with a diameter expansion of ≈30%. When compared with commercial expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), the bilayer graft shows better hemocompatibility (platelet adhesion, hemolysis rate, various clotting times, and plasma recalcification time (PRT)) and in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility, which thus is a promising material for the vascular graft.",2023,12,28
Chiral anomaly and Weyl orbit in three-dimensional Dirac semimetal Cd<sub>3</sub>As<sub>2</sub>grown on Si.,"Preparing Cd<sub>3</sub>As<sub>2</sub>, which is a three-dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetal in certain crystal orientation, on Si is highly desirable as such a sample may well be fully compatible with existing Si CMOS technology. However, there is a dearth of such a study regarding Cd<sub>3</sub>As<sub>2</sub>films grown on Si showing the chiral anomaly. Here, for the first time, we report the novel preparation and fabrication of a Cd<sub>3</sub>As<sub>2</sub>(112) film on a Si (111) substrate with a ZnTe (111) buffer layer which explicitly shows the chiral anomaly with a nontrivial Berry's phase of π. Despite the Hall carrier density (n<sub>3D</sub>≈9.42×10<sup>17</sup>cm<sup>-3</sup>) of our Cd<sub>3</sub>As<sub>2</sub>film, which is almost beyond the limit for the portents of a 3D Dirac semimetal to emerge, we observe large linear magnetoresistance in a perpendicular magnetic field and negative magnetoresistance in a parallel magnetic field. These results clearly demonstrate the chiral magnetic effect and 3D Dirac semimetallic behavior in our silicon-based Cd<sub>3</sub>As<sub>2</sub>film. Our tailoring growth of Cd<sub>3</sub>As<sub>2</sub>on a conventional substrate such as Si keeps the sample quality, while also achieving a low carrier concentration.",2023,12,28
Role of Coulomb Blockade in Nonlinear Transport of Conducting Polymers.,"Nonlinear I-V characteristics associated with Coulomb blockade (CB) in conducting polymers were systematically investigated. At low temperatures, a crossover from Ohmic to nonlinear behavior was observed, along with drastically enhanced noise in differential conductance right from the crossover. The fluctuation can be well explained by the Coulombic oscillation in the collective percolation system, where the charge transport is related to the Coulombic charging energy between crystalline domains. Furthermore, a distinct quantum conductance, the fingerprint of CB caused by the individual tunneling between crystalline grains, was observed in sub-100 nm devices, confirming a strong association between nonlinear I-V characteristics and Coulomb blockade effect.&#xD.",2023,12,28
Coulomb blockade and Coulomb staircases in CoBi nanoislands on SrTiO<sub>3</sub>(001).,"We successfully fabricated two-dimensional metallic CoBi nanoislands on SrTiO<sub>3</sub>(001) substrate by molecular beam epitaxy, and systematically investigated their electronic structures by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy in situ at 4.2 K. Coulomb blockade and Coulomb staircases with discrete and well-separated levels are observed for the individual nanoisland, which is attributed to single-electron tunneling via two tunnel junction barriers. They are in excellent agreement with the simulations based on orthodox theory. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the Coulomb blockade becomes weaker with increasing temperature and almost disappears at ~22 K in our variable temperature experiment, and its full-width at half-maximum of dI/dV peaks with temperature is ~ 6 mV. Our results provide a new platform for designing single-electron transistors that have potential applications in future microelectronics.&#xD.",2023,12,28
Self-powered semitransparent WS2/LaVO3 vertical-heterostructure photodetectors by employing interfacial hexagonal boron nitride.,"Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor and LaVO3 materials with high absorption coefficients in the visible light region are attractive structures for high-performance photodetector (PD) applications. Insulating 2D hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with a large band gap and excellent transmittance is a very attractive material as an interface between 2D/semiconductor heterostructures. We first introduce WS2/h-BN/LaVO3 PD. The photo-current/dark current ratio of the device exhibits a delta-function characteristic of 4 x 105 at 0 V, meaning ""self-powered"". The WS2/h-BN/LaVO3 PD shows up to 0.27 AW-1 responsivity (R) and 4.6 x 1010 cm Hz1/2 W-1 detectivity (D*) at 730 nm. Especially, it was confirmed that the D* performance improved by about 5 times compared to the WS2/LaVO3 device at zero bias. Additionally, it is suggested that the PD maintains 87 % of its initial R for 2000 h under an atmosphere with a temperature of 25°C and humidity of 30 %. Based on the above results, we suggest that the WS2/h-BN/LaVO3 heterojunction is promising as a self-powered optoelectronic device.&#xD.",2023,12,28
Upgrading the Separators Integrated with Desolvation and Selective Deposition toward the Stable Lithium Metal Batteries.,"A practical and effective approach to improve the cycle stability of high-energy density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is to selectively regulate the growth of the lithium anode. The design of desolvation and lithiophilic structure have proved to be significant means to regulate the lithium deposition process. Here, a fluorinated polymer lithiophilic separator (LS) loaded with a metal-organic framework (MOF801) is designed, which facilitates the rapid transfer of Li<sup>+</sup> within the separator owing to the MOF801-anchored PF<sub>6</sub> <sup>-</sup> from the electrolyte, Li deposition is confined in the plane resulting from the polymer fiber layer rich in lithiophilic groups (C─F). The numerical simulation results confirm that LS induces a uniform electric field and Li<sup>+</sup> concentration distribution. Visualization technology records the behavior of regular Li deposition in Li||Li and Li||Cu cells equipping LS. Therefore, LS exhibits an ultrahigh Li<sup>+</sup> transference number (t<sub>Li</sub> <sup>+</sup> = 0.80) and a large exchange current density (j<sub>0</sub> = 1.963 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> ). LS guarantees the stable operation of Li||Li cells for over 1000 h. In addition, the LiNi<sub>0.8</sub> Co<sub>0.1</sub> Mn<sub>0.1</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ||Li cell equipped with LS exhibits superior rate and cycle performances owing to the formation of LiF-rich robust SEI layers. This study provides a way forward for dendrite-free Li anodes from the perspective of separator engineering.",2023,12,28
Ion-Electron Transduction Layer of the SnS<sub>2</sub>-MoS<sub>2</sub> Heterojunction to Elevate Superior Interface Stability for All-Solid Sodium-Ion Selective Electrode.,"The high selectivity and fast ion response of all-solid sodium ion selective electrodes were widely applied in human sweat analysis. However, the potential drift due to insufficient interfacial capacitance leads to the deterioration of its stability and ultimately affects the potential accuracy of ion analysis. Designing a novel ion-electron transduction layer between the electrode and the ion selective membrane is an effective method to stabilize the interfacial potential. Herein, the SnS<sub>2</sub>-MoS<sub>2</sub> heterojunction material was constructed by doping Sn in MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets and used as the ion electron transduction layers of an all-solid sodium ion selective electrode for the first time, achieving the stable and efficient detection of Na<sup>+</sup> ions. The proposed electrode exhibited a Nernst slope of 57.86 mV/dec for the detection of Na<sup>+</sup> ions with a detection limit of 10<sup>-5.7</sup> M in the activity range of 10<sup>-6</sup>-10<sup>-1</sup> M. Via the electronic interaction at the heterojunction interfaces between SnS<sub>2</sub> and MoS<sub>2</sub> materials, the micro-nanostructure of the SnS<sub>2</sub>-MoS<sub>2</sub> heterojunction was changed and SnS<sub>2</sub>-MoS<sub>2</sub> as the ion-electron transduction layer acquired excellent capacitance (699 μF) and hydrophobicity (132°), resulting in a long-term potential stability of 1.37 μV/h. It was further proved that the large capacitance and high hydrophobicity of the ion-electron transduction layer are primary reasons for the excellent stability of the all-solid sodium ion selective electrode toward Na<sup>+</sup> ions.",2023,12,28
Phototransformation of Brominated Disinfection Byproducts and Toxicity Elimination in Sunlit-Ozonated Reclaimed Water.,"Ozonation is universally used during water treatment but can form hazardous brominated disinfection byproducts (Br-DBPs). While sunlight exposure is advised to reduce the risk of Br-DBPs, their phototransformation pathways remain insufficiently understood. Here, sunlight irradiation was found to reduce adsorbable organic bromine by 63%. Applying high-resolution mass spectrometry, the study investigated transformations of dissolved organic matter in sunlit-ozonated reclaimed water, revealing the number and abundance of assigned formulas decreased after irradiation. The Br-DBPs with O/C < 0.6 and MW > 400 Da were decreased or removed after irradiation, with the majority being CHOBr compounds. The peak intensity reduction ratio of CHOBr compounds correlated positively with double bound equivalent minus oxygen ratios but negatively with O/C, suggesting that photo-susceptible CHOBr compounds were highly unsaturated. Mass difference analysis revealed that the photodegradation pathways were mainly oxidation aligned with debromination. Three typical CHOBr molecular structures were resolved, and their photoproducts were proposed. Toxicity estimates indicated decreased toxicity in these photoproducts compared to their parent compounds, in line with experimentally determined values. Our proposed phototransformation pathways for Br-DBPs enhance our comprehension of their degradation and irradiation-induced toxicity reduction in reclaimed water, further illuminating their transformation under sunlight in widespread environmental scenarios.",2023,12,28
"Smart pillar[5]arene-based PDMAEMA/PES beads for selective dye pollutants removal: design, synthesis, chemical-physical characterization, and adsorption kinetic studies.","This article reports on the synthesis of an innovative smart polymer, P5-QPDMAEMA, opportunely developed with the aim of combining the responsiveness of PDMAEMA polymer and the host-guest properties of covalently linked pillar[5]arenes. Thanks to a traditional Non-Induced Phase Separation (NIPS) process performed at various coagulation pH, the blending of P5-QPDMAEMA with polyethersulfone gave rise to the formation of functional beads for the removal of organic dyes in water. Adsorption tests are carried out on all the produced blend-based beads, by employing two representative dyes, the cationic methylene blue (MB), and the anionic methyl orange (MO). In particular, the P5-QPDMAEMA based beads, prepared at acidic pH, featured the best MO removal rate (i.e., 91.3% after 150 minutes starting from a 20 mg·L-1solution) and a high selectivity towards the removal of the selected anionic dye. Based on the adsorption kinetics and isotherm calculations, the pseudo-first order and Freundlich models were shown to be the most suitable to describe the MO adsorption behavior, achieving a maximum adsorption capacity of 21.54 mg·g-1. Furthermore, zwitterionic beads are obtained by a post-functionalization of the PDMAEMA and the P5-QPDMAEMA based beads, to test their removal capability towards both anionic and cationic dyes, as shown.",2023,12,28
Attentional Focus Effects on Lower-Limb Muscular Strength in Athletes: A Systematic Review.,"Pompa, D, Carson, HJ, Beato, M, di Fronso, S, and Bertollo, M. Attentional focus effects on lower-limb muscular strength in athletes: A systematic review. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2023-Evidence links an athlete's focus of attention to enhancing strength performance. However, additional research is needed to investigate the applicability of studies beyond the tasks and population currently examined. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review studies concerning attentional focus effects on strength characteristics on lower-limb tasks in athletes. Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases were searched using PRISMA PERSIST guidelines and keywords related to the focus of attention, force production processes, and athletes. Subjects were categorized: world class (tier 5); elite (tier 4); highly trained (tier 3); trained/developmental (tier 2); nonathletes (tiers 1-0); and mixed (different levels). Fifteen of 296 studies met the inclusion criteria. Included studies investigated the focus of attention effects on performance (n = 6), between skill levels (n = 2), and for learning (n = 5), with respect to subject preference (n = 1); one study did not state the aim. Studies achieved an average risk of bias score of ""excellent""; however, findings suffered in the assessment of certainty. Only 2 studies reported an advantage for one type of attentional focus (external focus) across conditions (g = 0.13-0.42) with tier 2 and mixed tier athletes. Research does not address the needs of elite athletes, and there is limited evidence on each type of strength characteristics and muscle action. There is also a need to incorporate methodological steps to promote task-relevant instructions. Research should focus on contextualized information within professional practice to offer stronger translational implications for athletes and coaches.",2023,12,22
Impaired Neuromotor Control During Gait in Concussed Adolescents-A Frequency Analysis.,"Disruptions in gait function are common after concussion in adolescents; however, the neuromotor control deficits driving these gait disruptions are not well known. Fifteen concussed (age mean [SD]): 17.4 [0.6], 13 females, days since injury: 26.3 [9.9]) and 17 uninjured (age: 18.0 [0.7], 10 females) adolescents completed 3 trials each of single-task gait and dual-task gait (DT). During DT, participants simultaneously walked while completing a serial subtraction task. Gait metrics and variability in instantaneous mean frequency in lower extremity muscles were captured by inertial sensors and surface electromyography, respectively. A 2-way analysis of covariance was used to compare gait metrics across groups and conditions. Functional principal components analysis was used to identify regions of variability in instantaneous mean frequency curves. Functional principal component scores were compared across groups using a Welch statistic. Both groups displayed worse performance on gait metrics during DT condition compared to single-task, with no differences between groups (P < .001). Concussed adolescents displayed significantly greater instantaneous mean frequency, indicated by functional principal component 1, in the tibialis anterior, biceps femoris, and semitendinosus (P < .05) during single-task and DT compared with uninjured adolescents. Our observations suggest that concussed adolescents display inefficient motor unit recruitment lasting longer than 2 weeks following injury, regardless of the addition of a secondary task.",2023,12,27

Biocompatible Co-P Metallic Glasses with Superior Degradation Tolerance in Physiological Environments.,"Metallic glasses represent a class of metallic alloys with a fully amorphous structure and attractive properties, making them promising in bioimplant applications. Here, the degradation tolerance of biocompatible cobalt-phosphorus (Co-P) metallic glasses was studied in a simulated physiological environment. The metallic glasses were synthesized in the form of coatings through a facile electrodeposition approach. This method utilizes their outstanding surface characteristics and bypasses the size limitations usually associated with their bulk counterparts. The Co-P alloys showed exceptional tribological response with ∼14% lower coefficient of friction and 2 orders of magnitude lesser wear rate compared to SS316 stainless steel. In addition, the Co-P alloys showed a 3 times higher hardness and 4 times higher hardness/modulus ratio compared to SS316, indicating better elastic recovery under dynamic shear stresses that are common in load-bearing bioimplants. The Co-P metallic glasses exhibited excellent hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility in terms of lower platelet adhesion, spreading, and aggregation, a hemolysis ratio lower than 1%, and enhanced surface wettability, suggesting a superlative performance in bioimplant applications.",2023,12,28

Scleral Collagen Cross Linkage in progressive myopia.,"High myopia is often associated with local ectasia and scleral thinning. The progression of myopia depends upon scleral biochemical and biomechanical properties. Scleral thinning is associated with decreased collagen fiber diameter, defective collagen fibrillogenesis, and collagen cross-linking. Reversing these abnormalities may make the sclera tougher and might serve as a treatment option for myopic progression. Collagen cross-linking is a natural process in the cornea and sclera, which makes the structure stiff. Exogenous collagen cross-linkage is artificially induced with the help of external mediators by using light and dark methods. In this systematic review, we discussed existing literature available on the internet on current evidence-based applications of scleral collagen cross-linking (SXL) by using different interventions. In addition, we compared them in tabular form in terms of their technique, mechanisms, cytotoxicity, and the stage of transition from preclinical to clinical development. Furthermore, we discussed the in-vivo technique to evaluate the post-SXL scleral biomechanical property and outcome in the human eye.",2023,12,26
Developmental trajectories and cooperating genomic events define molecular subtypes of BCR::ABL1-positive ALL.,"Distinct diagnostic entities within BCR::ABL1-positive ALL are currently defined (ICC): 'lymphoid-only', with BCR::ABL1 observed exclusively in lymphatic precursors versus 'multilineage', where BCR::ABL1 is also present in other hematopoietic lineages. Here, we analyzed transcriptomes of n=327 BCR::ABL1-positive ALL patients (age: 2 years - 84 years, median: 46) and identified two main gene expression clusters reproducible across four independent patient cohorts. FISH analysis of FACS-sorted hematopoietic compartments showed distinct BCR::ABL1 involvement in myeloid cells for these clusters (n=18/18 vs n=3/16 patients, p<0.001), indicating that a 'multilineage' or 'lymphoid' BCR::ABL1 subtype can be inferred from gene expression. Further subclusters grouped samples according to cooperating genomic events (multilineage: HBS1L deletion or monosomy 7; lymphoid: IKZF1-/- or CDKN2A / PAX5 deletions / hyperdiploidy). A novel HSB1L transcript was highly specific for BCR::ABL1 multilineage cases independent of HBS1L genomic aberrations. Treatment on current GMALL protocols resulted in comparable disease-free survival (DFS) for 'multilineage' vs. 'lymphoid' cluster patients (3-year DFS: 70% vs 61%, p=0.530; n=91). However, the IKZF1-/- enriched lymphoid subcluster was associated with inferior DFS, whereas hyperdiploid cases showed a superior outcome. Thus, gene expression clusters define underlying developmental trajectories and distinct patterns of cooperating events in BCR::ABL1-positive ALL with prognostic relevance.",2023,12,28
"DFT-Spectroscopy Integrated Identification Method on Unknown Terrorist Chemical Mixtures by Incorporating Experimental and Theoretical GC-MS, NMR, IR, and DFT-NMR/IR Data.","In the event of a chemical attack, the rapid identification of unknown chemical agents is critical for an effective emergency response and treatment of victims. However, identifying unknown compounds is difficult, particularly when relying on traditional methods such as gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, LC-MS). In this study, we developed a density functional theory and spectroscopy integrated identification method (D-SIIM) for the possible detection of unknown or unidentified terrorist materials, specifically chemical warfare agents (CWAs). The D-SIIM uses a combination of GC-MS, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculation-based NMR/IR predictions to identify potential CWA candidates based on their chemical signatures. Using D-SIIM, we successfully verified the presence of blister and nerve agent simulants in samples by excluding other compounds (ethyl propyl sulfide and methylphosphonic acid), which were predicted to be candidates with high probability by GC-MS. The findings of this study demonstrate that the D-SIIM can detect substances that are likely present in CWA mixtures and can be used to identify unknown terrorist chemicals.",2023,12,28
The limits of the constant-rate birth-death prior for phylogenetic tree topology inference.,"Birth-death models are stochastic processes describing speciation and extinction through time and across taxa, and are widely used in biology for inference of evolutionary timescales. Previous research has highlighted how the expected trees under the constant-rate birth-death (crBD) model tend to differ from empirical trees, for example with respect to the amount of phylogenetic imbalance. However, our understanding of how trees differ between the crBD model and the signal in empirical data remains incomplete. In this Point of View, we aim to expose the degree to which the crBD model differs from empirically inferred phylogenies and test the limits of the model in practice. Using a wide range of topology indices to compare crBD expectations against a comprehensive dataset of 1189 empirically estimated trees, we confirm that crBD model trees frequently differ topologically compared with empirical trees. To place this in the context of standard practice in the field, we conducted a meta-analysis for a subset of the empirical studies. When comparing studies that used Bayesian methods and crBD priors with those that used other non-crBD priors and non-Bayesian methods (i.e., maximum likelihood methods), we do not find any significant differences in tree topology inferences. To scrutinize this finding for the case of highly imbalanced trees, we selected the 100 trees with the greatest imbalance from our dataset, simulated sequence data for these tree topologies under various evolutionary rates, and re-inferred the trees under maximum likelihood and using the crBD model in a Bayesian setting. We find that when the substitution rate is low, the crBD prior results in overly balanced trees, but the tendency is negligible when substitution rates are sufficiently high. Overall, our findings demonstrate the general robustness of crBD priors across a broad range of phylogenetic inference scenarios, but also highlights that empirically observed phylogenetic imbalance is highly improbable under the crBD model, leading to systematic bias in data sets with limited information content.",2023,12,28
Discovery and Mechanistic Elucidation of NQO1-Bioactivatable Small Molecules That Overcome Resistance to Degraders.,"Degraders hold the promise to efficiently inactivate previously intractable disease-relevant targets. Unlike traditional inhibitors, degraders act substoichiometrically and rely on the hijacked proteolysis machinery, which can also act as an entry point for resistance. To fully harness the potential of targeted protein degradation, it is crucial to comprehend resistance mechanisms and formulate effective strategies to overcome them. We conducted a chemical screening to identify synthetic lethal vulnerabilities of cancer cells that exhibit widespread resistance to degraders. Comparative profiling followed by tailored optimization delivered the small molecule RBS-10, which shows preferential cytotoxicity against cells pan-resistant to degraders. Multiomics deconvolution of the mechanism of action revealed that RBS-10 acts as a prodrug bioactivated by the oxidoreductase enzyme NQO1, which is highly overexpressed in our resistance models. Collectively, our work informs on NQO1 as an actionable vulnerability to overcome resistance to degraders and as a biomarker to selectively exploit bioactivatable prodrugs in cancer.",2023,12,28
Factor XI and coagulation. Factor XI inhibitors - antithrombotic perspectives.,"Factor XI is a zymogen with an important role in the coagulation cascade. It is activated by FXII, thrombin and or it can be autoactivated. It has a prothrombotic effect after being activated by thrombin, but also through its antifibrinolytic action, stabilizing the formed clot. Hereditary deficiency of FXI causes haemophilia C - a disease manifested by an usually provoked, small to moderate mucosal bleeding. People with severe FXI deficiency have a low risk of thrombotic events. Conversely, increased FXI values have been found to be associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism and ischemic stroke. Lowering serum FXI levels has become a treatment target for the prevention of thrombotic events. New pharmacological agents - FXI inhibitors - have been investigated in phase II clinical trials, with promising results in terms of efficacy and safety in the prevention of thrombotic events. FXI inhibitors are emerging as new anticoagulant agents with broad indication prospects beyond direct oral anticoagulants and vitamin K antagonists.",2023,12,28

Scientific Writing in Physiology: Confused/Misused Terms and Phrases.,"One aspect of effective scientific writing in physiology is the ability to select the correct words or short phrases to use when developing your narratives. This task is made difficult because many commonly used terms have seemingly viable alternatives, leading to confusion, uncertainty, and possible misuse of those words and phrases. In this perspective, we attempt to provide general guidance when selecting between or among options for commonly confused and misused terms in scientific writing. We have organized inaccurate, confusing, commonly misused, and misleading words and phrases into separate tables categorized as general language, demographic descriptors, general science, physiological sciences, and exercise physiology. Our modest hope is that the current perspective facilitates effective writing and encourages discussion regarding the importance of clarity in writing.",2023,12,28
Physiological responses to 9 hours of heat exposure in young and older adults. Part III: Association with self-reported symptoms and mood-state.,"Older adults are at greater risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality during heat waves, which are commonly linked to impaired thermoregulation. However, little is known about the influence of increasing age on the relation between thermal strain and perceptual responses during daylong heat exposure. We evaluated thermal and perceptual responses in 20 young (19-31 years) and 39 older adults (20 with hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes; 61-78 years) resting in the heat for 9 hours (heat index: 37°C). Body core and mean skin temperature areas under the curve (AUC, hours 0-9) were assessed as indicators of cumulative thermal strain. Self-reported symptoms (68-item environmental symptoms questionnaire), and mood-disturbance (40-item profile of mood states questionnaire) were assessed at end-heating (adjusted for pre-scores). Body core temperature AUC was 2.4°C·h [1.0, 3.7] higher in older relative to young adults (P<0.001), while mean skin temperature AUC was not different (-0.5°C·h [-4.1, 3.2] P=0.799). At end-heating, self-reported symptoms were not different between age groups (0.99-fold [0.80, 1.23], P=0.923), with or without adjustment for body core or mean skin temperature AUC (both P≥0.824). Mood-disturbance was 0.93-fold [0.88, 0.99] lower in older, relative to young adults (P=0.031). Older adults with and without chronic health conditions experienced similar thermal strain, yet those with these conditions reported lower symptom scores and mood disturbance compared to young adults and their age-matched counterparts (all P≤0.026). Although older adults experienced heightened thermal strain during the 9 h heat exposure, they did not experience greater self-reported symptoms or mood disturbance relative to young adults.",2023,12,28
An experimental test of the evolutionary consequences of sympatry in Drosophila subquinaria.,"Prezygotic isolation is often stronger between sympatric as opposed to allopatric taxa, but the underlying cause can be difficult to infer from comparative studies alone. Experimental evolution, where evolutionary responses to treatments manipulating the presence/absence of heterospecific individuals are tracked, can provide a powerful complementary approach. We used experimental evolution to investigate a naturally occurring pattern of reproductive character displacement in the mushroom-feeding fly, Drosophila subquinaria. In nature, female D. subquinaria from populations sympatric with the closely related D. recens discriminate more strongly against heterospecific males than do females from allopatric populations. Starting with 16 replicate allopatric populations of D. subquinaria, we manipulated the presence/absence of D. recens during mating (experimental sympatry vs. control) and, when present, we allowed hybrids to live or killed them each generation. Across 12 generations, heterospecific offspring production from no-choice mating trials between D. subquinaria females and D. recens males declined in both experimental sympatry treatments relative to the control, suggesting increased sexual isolation. Male cuticular hydrocarbon profiles also evolved, but only in the hybrids killed treatment. Our results strongly imply that the existing reproductive character displacement in wild D. subquinaria populations was an evolutionary response to selection arising from secondary contact with D. recens.",2023,12,28
Oral fecal transplantation enriches Lachnospiraceae and butyrate to mitigate acute liver injury.,"While fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) shows promise in treating human diseases, oral capsule FMT is more accepted and accessible to patients. However, microbe selection in the upper gastrointestinal tract (UGIT) through oral administration remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that short-term oral fecal gavage (OFG) alleviates acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury (AILI) in mice, regardless of the divergent effects of commensal gut microbes. Pasteurized fecal gavage yields similar therapeutic effects. OFG enriches gut Lachnospiraceae and butyrate compared to donor feces. Butyrate mitigates AILI-induced ferroptosis via AMPK-ULK1-p62 signaling to simultaneously induce mitophagy and Nrf2 antioxidant responses. Combined N-acetylcysteine and butyrate administration significantly improves AILI mouse survival rates. These observations indicate the significance of the UGIT in modulating the implanted fecal microbes through oral administration and its potential biological and clinical impacts. Our findings also highlight a possible strategy for applying microbial metabolites to treat acute liver injury.",2023,12,27
Reconstruction of Adaptive Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron to Enhance the Spiking Neural Networks Performance by Establishing Complex Dynamics.,"Since digital spiking signals can carry rich information and propagate with low computational consumption, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received great attention from neuroscientists and are regarded as the future development object of neural networks. However, generating the appropriate spiking signals remains challenging, which is related to the dynamics property of neurons. Most existing studies imitate the biological neurons based on the correlation of synaptic input and output, but these models have only one time constant, thus ignoring the structural differentiation and versatility in biological neurons. In this article, we propose the reconstruction of adaptive leaky integrate-and-fire (R-ALIF) neuron to perform complex behaviors similar to real neurons. First, a synaptic cleft time constant is introduced into the membrane voltage charging equation to distinguish the leakage degree between the neuron membrane and the synaptic cleft, which can expand the representation space of spiking neurons to facilitate SNNs to obtain better information expression way. Second, R-ALIF constructs a voltage threshold adjustment equation to balance the firing rate of output signals. Third, three time constants are transformed into learnable parameters, enabling the adaptive adjustment of dynamics equation and enhancing the information expression ability of SNNs. Fourth, the computational graph of R-ALIF is optimized to improve the performance of SNNs. Moreover, we adopt a temporal dropout (TemDrop) method to solve the overfitting problem in SNNs and propose a data augmentation method for neuromorphic datasets. Finally, we evaluate our method on CIFAR10-DVS, ASL-DVS, and CIFAR-100, and achieve top1 accuracy of 81.0% , 99.8% , and 67.83% , respectively, with few time steps. We believe that our method will further promote the development of SNNs trained by spatiotemporal backpropagation (STBP).",2023,12,28
Dynamic Model Interpretation-Guided Online Active Learning Scheme for Real-Time Safety Assessment.,"Chunk-level real-time safety assessment of dynamic systems is a critical component of industrial processes, which is essential to prevent hazards and reduce the risk of injury or damage to equipment and facilities, especially in nonstationary environments. In this context, multiple real and complex concept drifts are inevitable in industrial settings, making it crucial to understand their detection and adaptation processes. The incremental learning scheme should also be well considered. However, existing methods have certain limitations in dealing with such issues. In this article, a dynamic model interpretation-guided online active learning scheme, termed a dynamic model interpretation-guided learning scheme (DMI-LS), is proposed. Specifically, the model update strategy with chunk data is designed based on the implementation of the broad learning system. A novel query strategy is then investigated to consider the ranking preference difference, which relies on the interpretation generated by the explainable artificial intelligence method. Several experiments based on the JiaoLong deep-sea manned submersible data are conducted to verify the effects of the proposed DMI-LS. The results show that it outperforms the other advanced existing approaches with different settings in most scenarios.",2023,12,28
Underground Diagnosis Based on GPR and Learning in the Model Space.,"Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has been widely used in pipeline detection and underground diagnosis. In practical applications, the characteristics of the GPR data of the detected area and the likely underground anomalous structures could be rarely acknowledged before fully analyzing the obtained GPR data, causing challenges to identify the underground structures or anomalies automatically. In this paper, a GPR B-scan image diagnosis method based on learning in the model space is proposed. The idea of learning in the model space is to use models fitted on parts of data as more stable and parsimonious representations of the data. For the GPR image, 2-Direction Echo State Network (2D-ESN) is proposed to fit the image segments through the next item prediction. By building the connections between the points on the image in both the horizontal and vertical directions, the 2D-ESN regards the GPR image segment as a whole and could effectively capture the dynamic characteristics of the GPR image. And then, semi-supervised and supervised learning methods could be further implemented on the 2D-ESN models for underground diagnosis. Experiments on real-world datasets are conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",2023,12,28
Dual-View Learning Based on Images and Sequences for Molecular Property Prediction.,"The prediction of molecular properties remains a challenging task in the field of drug design and development. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the analysis of biological images. Molecular images, as a novel representation, have proven to be competitive, yet they lack explicit information and detailed semantic richness. Conversely, semantic information in SMILES sequences is explicit but lacks spatial structural details. Therefore, in this study, we focus on and explore the relationship between these two types of representations, proposing a novel multimodal architecture named ISMol. ISMol relies on a cross-attention mechanism to extract information representations of molecules from both images and SMILES strings, thereby predicting molecular properties. Evaluation results on 14 small molecule ADMET datasets indicate that ISMol outperforms machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models based on single-modal representations. In addition, we analyze our method through a large number of experiments to test the superiority, interpretability and generalizability of the method. In summary, ISMol offers a powerful deep learning toolbox for drug discovery in a variety of molecular properties.",2023,12,28
Bilateral Supervision Network for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation.,"Massive high-quality annotated data is required by fully-supervised learning, which is difficult to obtain for image segmentation since the pixel-level annotation is expensive, especially for medical image segmentation tasks that need domain knowledge. As an alternative solution, semi-supervised learning (SSL) can effectively alleviate the dependence on the annotated samples by leveraging abundant unlabeled samples. Among the SSL methods, mean-teacher (MT) is the most popular one. However, in MT, teacher model's weights are completely determined by student model's weights, which will lead to the training bottleneck at the late training stages. Besides, only pixel-wise consistency is applied for unlabeled data, which ignores the category information and is susceptible to noise. In this paper, we propose a bilateral supervision network with bilateral exponential moving average (bilateral-EMA), named BSNet to overcome these issues. On the one hand, both the student and teacher models are trained on labeled data, and then their weights are updated with the bilateral-EMA, and thus the two models can learn from each other. On the other hand, pseudo labels are used to perform bilateral supervision for unlabeled data. Moreover, for enhancing the supervision, we adopt adversarial learning to enforce the network generate more reliable pseudo labels for unlabeled data. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets to evaluate the proposed BSNet, and results show that BSNet can improve the semi-supervised segmentation performance by a large margin and surpass other state-of-the-art SSL methods.",2023,12,28
An overview of retinal light damage models for preclinical studies on age-related macular degeneration: identifying molecular hallmarks and therapeutic targets.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a complex, multifactorial disease leading to progressive and irreversible retinal degeneration, whose pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated yet. Due to the complexity and to the multiple features of the disease, many efforts have been made to develop animal models which faithfully reproduce the overall AMD hallmarks or that are able to mimic the different AMD stages. In this context, light damage (LD) rodent models of AMD represent a suitable and reliable approach to mimic the different AMD forms (dry, wet and geographic atrophy) while maintaining the time-dependent progression of the disease. In this review, we comprehensively reported how the LD paradigms reproduce the main features of human AMD. We discuss the capability of these models to broaden the knowledge in AMD research, with a focus on the mechanisms and the molecular hallmarks underlying the pathogenesis of the disease. We also critically revise the remaining challenges and future directions for the use of LD models.",2023,12,29
Single-cell deconvolution reveals high lineage- and location-dependent heterogeneity in mesenchymal multivisceral stage IV colorectal cancer.,"Metastasized colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with a poor prognosis and rapid disease progression. Besides hepatic metastasis, peritoneal carcinomatosis is the major cause of death in UICC (Union for International Cancer Control) stage IV CRC patients. Insights into differential site-specific reconstitution of tumour cells and the corresponding tumour microenvironment are still missing. Here, we analysed the transcriptome of single cells derived from murine multivisceral CRC and delineated the inter-metastatic cellular heterogeneity regarding tumour epithelium, stroma and immune cells. Interestingly, we found an intercellular site-specific network of cancer associated fibroblasts and tumour epithelium during peritoneal metastasis as well as an autologous feed-forward loop in cancer stem cells. We furthermore deciphered a metastatic dysfunctional adaptive immunity by a loss of B cell dependent antigen presentation and consecutive effector T cell exhaustion. Furthermore, we demonstrated major similarities of this murine metastatic CRC model with human disease and -based on the results of our analysis- provided an auspicious site-specific immune modulatory treatment approach for stage IV CRC by intraperitoneal checkpoint inhibition.",2023,12,28
Empathy and Equity: Key Considerations for Large Language Model Adoption in Health Care.,"The growing presence of large language models (LLMs) in health care applications holds significant promise for innovative advancements in patient care. However, concerns about ethical implications and potential biases have been raised by various stakeholders. Here, we evaluate the ethics of LLMs in medicine along 2 key axes: empathy and equity. We outline the importance of these factors in novel models of care and develop frameworks for addressing these alongside LLM deployment.",2023,12,28
Effects of a team QI method in a national clinical audit programme of four clinical specialties in Ministry of Health hospitals in Saudi Arabia.,"Background In 2018, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Saudi Arabia developed a clinical excellence strategy. An objective was to reduce variation in clinical practices in MoH hospitals, particularly for conditions with high mortality in Saudi Arabia, by applying best practice clinical standards and using the clinical audit process to measure clinical practice. The strategy included working with multi-professional teams in hospitals to implement improvements needed in clinical practice. To test the feasibility of carrying out national clinical audits in MoH hospitals, audits were carried out in 16 MoH hospitals on four clinical subjects - acute myocardial infarction, major trauma, sepsis and stroke. Methods Clinical expert groups, including Saudi clinicians and an international clinical expert, developed clinical care standards for the four conditions from analyses of international and Saudi clinical guidelines. The audits were designed with the expert groups. Multi-professional teams were appointed to carry out the audits in designated MoH hospitals. Data collectors in each hospital were trained to collect data. Workshops were held with the teams on the clinical care standards and how data would be collected for the audits, and later, on the findings of data collection and how to use the improvement process to implement changes to improve compliance with the standards. After four months, data collection was repeated to determine if compliance with the clinical care standards had improved. Data collected from each hospital for both cycles of data collection were independently reliably tested. Results All designated hospitals participated in the audits, collecting and submitting data for two rounds of data collection and implementing improvement plans after the first round of data collection. All hospitals made substantial improvements in clinical practices. Of a total of 84 measures used to assess compliance with a total of 52 clinical care standards for the four clinical conditions, improvements were made by hospital teams in 58 (69.1%) of the measures. Improvements were statistically significant for 34 (40.5%) of the measures. Conclusion The project demonstrated that well-designed and executed audits using evidence-based clinical care standards can result in substantial improvements in clinical practices in MoH hospitals in Saudi Arabia. Keys to success were the improvement methodology built into the audit process and the requirement for hospitals to appoint multi-professional teams to carry out the audits. The approach adds to evidence on the effectiveness of clinical audits in achieving improvements in clinical quality and can be replicated in national audit programmes.",2023,12,28
Temperature-Regulated Flowering Locus T Like gene Coordinates the Spike Initiation in Phalaenopsis orchid.,"Phalaenopsis aphrodite can be induced to initiate spike growth and flowering by exposure to low ambient temperatures. However, the factors and mechanisms responsible for spike initiation in P. aphrodite remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that a repressor FLOWERING LOCUS T-like gene, FTL, can act as a negative regulator of spike initiation in P. aphrodite. The mRNA transcripts of PaFTL are consistently high during high ambient temperature, thereby preventing premature spike initiation. However, during low ambient temperature, PaFTL expression falls while FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) expression increases, allowing for spike initiation. Knock-down of PaFTL expression through virus-inducing gene silencing (VIGS) promoted spike initiation at 30/28°C. Moreover, PaFTL interacts with FLOWERING LOCUS D (FD) in a similar manner to FT, to regulate downstream flowering initiation genes. Transgenic P. aphrodite plants exhibiting high expression of PaFTL do not undergo spike initiation, even when exposed to low ambient temperatures. These findings shed light on the flowering mechanisms in Phalaenopsis and provide new insights into how perennial plants govern spike initiation in response to temperature cues.",2023,12,28
Adenomyoepithelioma of the Breast: Radiologic-Pathologic Correlation and Management.,"Adenomyoepithelioma (AME) is a rare, usually benign breast neoplasm with low potential for malignant transformation. Imaging features are nonspecific and overlap with other benign and malignant breast lesions. On mammography, AME most often presents as a mass, usually oval in shape, with variable reported margins. Less commonly, AME can present mammographically as an asymmetry or can be mammographically occult. Associated calcifications are uncommon. On US, AME is usually seen as a hypoechoic oval mass, but it can also manifest as a complex cystic and solid mass. On US, the majority of AME have noncircumscribed margins (indistinct, angular, or microlobulated). Internal vascularity is usually present, and posterior enhancement can be seen. Although there is limited literature on MRI features, the most frequent finding is an irregular mass with washout kinetics; T2 hyperintensity can be observed. These nonspecific and often suspicious imaging features usually merit biopsy. On histologic analysis, AME is characterized by a biphasic proliferation of myoepithelial and epithelial cells. Pathologic diagnosis can be difficult due to the variety of histologic features of AME and heterogeneity in these tumors, especially when sampling is limited, such as in core needle biopsies. Wide local surgical excision of AME is recommended due to potential for recurrence and malignant transformation.",2023,12,28
Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Prophylaxis of Chronic Graft-vs-Host Disease After Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant: An Open-Label Randomized Clinical Trial.,Chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) limits the long-term benefit of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

LncRNA CARD8-AS1 suppresses lung adenocarcinoma progression by enhancing TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of TXNRD1.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in the tumorigenesis and progression of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, little was known about the role of lncRNAs in high-risk LUAD subtypes: micropapillary-predominant adenocarcinoma (MPA) and solid-predominant adenocarcinoma (SPA). In this study, we conducted a systematic screening of differentially expressed lncRNAs using RNA sequencing in ten paired MPA/SPA tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Consequently, 110 significantly up-regulated lncRNAs and 288 aberrantly down-regulated lncRNAs were identified (|Log2Foldchange| ≥ 1 & corrected P < 0.05). The top ten lncRNAs were further analyzed in 89 MPA/SPA tumor tissues and 59 normal tissues from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. Among them, CARD8-AS1 showed the most significant differential expression, and decreased expression of CARD8-AS1 was significantly associated with a poorer prognosis. Functionally, CARD8-AS1 overexpression remarkably suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of LUAD cells both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, inhibition of CARD8-AS1 yielded opposite effects. Mechanistically, CARD8-AS1 acted as a scaffold to facilitate the interaction between TXNRD1 and E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, thereby promoting the degradation of TXNRD1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Additionally, TXNRD1 was found to promote LUAD cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. Furthermore, the suppressed progression of LUAD cells resulting from CARD8-AS1 overexpression could be significantly reversed by simultaneous overexpression of TXNRD1. In conclusion, this study revealed that the lncRNA CARD8-AS1 played a suppressive role in the progression of LUAD by enhancing TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of TXNRD1. The CARD8-AS1-TRIM25-TXNRD1 axis may represent a promising therapeutic target for LUAD.",2023,12,28

Manipulating the Microenvironment of Single Atoms by Switching Support Crystallinity for Industrial Hydrogen Evolution.,"Modulating the microenvironment of single-atom catalysts (SACs) is critical to optimizing catalytic activity. Herein, we innovatively propose a strategy to improve the local reaction environment of Ru single atoms by precisely switching the crystallinity of the support from high crystalline and low crystalline, which significantly improves the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. The Ru single-atom catalyst anchored on low-crystalline nickel hydroxide (Ru-LC-Ni(OH)2) reconstructs the distribution balance of the interfacial ions due to the activation effect of metal dangling bonds on the support. Single-site Ru with a low oxidation state induces the aggregation of hydronium ions (H3O+), leading to the formation of a local acidic microenvironment in alkaline media, breaking the pH-dependent HER activity. As a comparison, the Ru single-atom catalyst anchored on high-crystalline nickel hydroxide (Ru-HC-Ni(OH)2) exhibits a sluggish Volmer step and a conventional local reaction environment. As expected, Ru-LC-Ni(OH)2 requires low overpotentials of 9 and 136 mV at 10 and 1000 mA cm-2 in alkaline conditions and operates stably at 500 mA cm-2 for 500 h in an alkaline seawater anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer. This study provides a new perspective for constructing highly active single-atom electrocatalysts.",2023,12,28
Hyperbaric oxygen alleviates selective domains of cognitive and motor deficits in female 5xFAD mice.,"Treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been limited to managing of symptoms or anti-amyloid therapy with limited results and uncertainty. Seeking out new therapies that can reverse the effects of this devastating disease is important. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy could be such a candidate as it has been shown to improve brain function in certain neurological conditions. Furthermore, the role sex plays in the vulnerability/resilience to AD remains equivocal. An understanding of what makes one sex more vulnerable to AD could unveil new pathways for therapy development. In this study, we investigated the effects of HBO on cognitive, motor, and affective function in a mouse model of AD (5xFAD) and assessed protein oxidation in peripheral tissues as a safety indicator. The motor and cognitive abilities of 5xFAD mice were significantly impaired. HBO therapy improved cognitive flexibility and associative learning of 5xFAD females but not males, but HBO had no effect other aspects of cognition. HBO also reversed AD-related declines in balance but had no impact on gait and anxiety-like behavior. HBO did not affect body weights or oxidative stress in peripheral tissues. Our study provides further support for HBO therapy as a potential treatment for AD and emphasizes the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in therapeutic development. Further investigations into the underlying mechanisms of HBO's sex-specific responses are warranted, as well as optimizing treatment protocols for maximum benefits.",2023,12,28

"Fluorinated 2-arylchroman-4-ones and their derivatives: synthesis, structure and antiviral activity.","A number of new biologically interesting fluorinated 2-arylchroman-4-ones and their 3-arylidene derivatives were synthesized based on the p-toluenesulfonic acid-catalyzed one-pot reaction of 2-hydroxyacetophenones with benzaldehydes. It was found that obtained (E)-3-arylidene-2-aryl-chroman-4-ones reacted with malononitrile under base conditions to form 4,5-diaryl-4H,5H-pyrano[3,2-c]chromenes. The structures of the synthesized fluorinated compounds were confirmed by <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>19</sup>F, and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectral data, and for some representatives of heterocycles also using NOESY spectra and X-ray diffraction analysis. A large series of obtained flavanone derivatives as well as products of their modification (35 examples) containing from 1 to 12 fluorine atoms in the structure was tested in vitro for cytotoxicity in MDCK cell line and for antiviral activity against influenza A virus. Among the studied heterocycles 6,8-difluoro-2-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)chroman-4-one (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6 μM, SI = 150) exhibited the greatest activity against influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus. Moreover, this compound appeared active against phylogenetically distinct influenza viruses, A(H5N2) and influenza B (SI's of 53 and 42, correspondingly). The data obtained suggest that the fluorinated derivatives of 2-arylchroman-4-ones are prospective scaffolds for further development of potent anti-influenza antivirals.",2023,12,28

"Sterically Controlled Synthesis of Amine-Free CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets for Stable, Pure-Blue Light Emission.","Metal halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) have demonstrated excellent optical properties for light-emitting applications and achieved tunable blue luminescence through thickness control. However, their translation into electronic devices has lagged behind due to poor colloidal and film stability. The main reason for this is the deprotonation of their surface-capped ammonium passivating ligands, resulting in NPL aggregation. Here we report the first facile synthesis of amine-free pure-blue CsPbBr3 NPLs with outstanding thermal and light stability. This is achieved by utilizing an amine-free phosphine oxide route with a surface capping molecule exhibiting large steric hindrance to prevent NPL aggregation. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) spectroscopy suggests slower ligand exchange in amine-free NPLs compared to the conventional NPLs, which can be attributed to the strong binding strength of the designated ligand. Consequently, the amine-free NPLs exhibited superior stability against radiation, heat and moisture. We further demonstrate the importance of acid-base equilibrium in this amine-free synthesis route. Through solvent neutralization and passivation with various alkali carbonates, the resulting NPLs attained near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and pure blue emission.",2023,12,28
"Spatial and Environmental Correlates of Prevalence of Treatment for Substance Use Disorders, Retention, and SUD Services Utilization in South Sardinia.","This study explored the economic, social, and spatial correlates of treatment prevalence, retention, and service utilization for substance use disorder (SUD) in South Sardinia. Data from 1,667 patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of SUD were extracted from the medical records of individuals assisted by three public addiction services in 2019. We used a spatial autoregressive model, a parametric proportional hazard model, and Poisson regression to examine the associations of spatial factors and residents' socioeconomic status with the prevalence of treatment at the census block level, treatment retention, and SUD service utilization at the individual level. The prevalence was higher among residents of areas closer to competent treatment centers, with the worst building conservation status, a lower percentage of high school and university graduates, and a higher percentage of unemployed, divorced, separated, or widowed residents. Men who were older at the time of their first treatment access; primary users of cocaine, cannabis, and alcohol; had higher education level; and who lived far from competent treatment centers and closer to drug trafficking centers interrupted their treatment earlier. Primary heroin users experienced more SUD treatment encounters. Living in economically and socially disadvantaged areas and near treatment facilities was associated with a higher prevalence, whereas living near drug-dealing centers and far from competent treatment centers was associated with a decrease in treatment retention.",2023,12,28
Structural elucidation of a non-starch polysaccharides from Lilii Bulbus and its protective effects against corticosterone-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells.,"Lilii Bulbus is a folk medicine for both culinary and medicinal purpose. In traditional medicine theory, Lilii Bulbus is usually used as an complementary therapy for nourishing the heart and lung, clearing heat in the treatment of mental instability and depression. In this study, NLPS-1a (Mw = 2610 Da, DP = 16), a water-soluble non-starch Lilii Bulbus polysaccharides, was isolated and purified. Structural analysis showed that NLPS-1a mainly contained Man and Glc with a molar ratio of 11.137 and 9.427. The glycosidic linkages of NLPS-1a were 1,3-Manp (59.93%), 1,2-Glcp (37.93%), T-Glcp (1.21%) and T-Manp (0.93%), indicating the highly-linear structures. In addition, NLPS-1a could significantly repair the injury of PC12 cells induced by corticosterone (CORT), reduce Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and decrease the cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Above all, the results indicated that NLPS-1a had protective effects against CORT-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells, and might be a natural antidepressant, which enriched the study of the metabolic mechanism between herbal polysaccharides and antidepressant.",2023,12,28

Genomic insights and advanced machine learning: characterizing autism spectrum disorder biomarkers and genetic interactions.,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by altered brain connectivity and function. In this study, we employed advanced bioinformatics and explainable AI to analyze gene expression associated with ASD, using data from five GEO datasets. Among 351 neurotypical controls and 358 individuals with autism, we identified 3,339 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) with an adjusted p-value (≤ 0.05). A subsequent meta-analysis pinpointed 342 DEGs (adjusted p-value ≤ 0.001), including 19 upregulated and 10 down-regulated genes across all datasets. Shared genes, pathogenic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), chromosomal positions, and their impact on biological pathways were examined. We identified potential biomarkers (HOXB3, NR2F2, MAPK8IP3, PIGT, SEMA4D, and SSH1) through text mining, meriting further investigation. Additionally, ‎we shed light on the roles of RPS4Y1 and KDM5D genes in neurogenesis and neurodevelopment. Our analysis detected 1,286 SNPs linked to ASD-related conditions, of which 14 high-risk SNPs were located on chromosomes 10 and X. We highlighted potential missense SNPs associated with FGFR inhibitors, suggesting that it may serve as a promising biomarker for responsiveness to targeted therapies. Our explainable AI model identified the MID2 gene as a potential ASD biomarker.

Occurrence and environmental risk assessment of 4 estrogenic compounds in surface water in Belgium in the frame of the EU Watch List.,"The presence of natural estrogens estrone (E1), 17β-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3) and synthetic estrogen 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) in the aquatic environment has raised concerns because of their high potency as endocrine disrupting chemicals. The European Commission (EC) established a Watch List of contaminants of emerging concerns including E1, E2 and EE2. The proposed environmental quality standards (EQSs) are 3.6, 0.4, 0.035 ng/L, for E1, E2, EE2, respectively. A thorough evaluation of analytical procedures developed by several studies aiming to perform sampling campaigns in different European countries highlighted that the required limits of quantification in surface water were not reached, especially for EE2 and to a lesser extent for E2. Moreover, data regarding the occurrence of these contaminants in Belgian surface water are very limited. A sampling campaign was therefore performed on a wide range of rivers in Belgium (accounting for a total of 63 samples). The detection frequencies of E1, E2, E3 and EE2 were 100, 98, 86 and 48%, respectively. E1 showed the highest mean concentration (= 4.433 ng/L). In contrast, the mean concentration of EE2 was 0.042 ng/L. The risk quotients (RQs) were calculated based on the respective EQS of each analyte. The frequency of exceedance of the EQS was 31.7% for E1, EE2, while it increased to 44.4% for E2. The extent of exceedance of the EQS, represented by the 95th percentile of the RQ dataset, was higher than 1 for E1, E2, EE2. The use of a confusion matrix was investigated to try to predict the risk posed by E2, EE2, based on the concentration of E1.",2023,12,28

Development of fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of Staphylococcus aureus.,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major pathogen that causes infections and life-threatening diseases. Although antibiotics, such as methicillin, have been used, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) causes high morbidity and mortality rates, and conventional detection methods are difficult to be used because of time-consuming process. To control the spread of S. aureus, a development of a rapid and simple detection method is required. In this study, we generated a fluorescent anti-S. aureus antibody, and established a novel fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA)-based S. aureus detection method. The method showed high sensitivity and low limit of detection toward MRSA detection. The assay time for FLISA was 5 h, which was faster than that of conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or rapid ELISA. Moreover, the FLISA-based detection method was applied to diagnose clinically isolated MRSA samples that required only 5.3 h of preincubation.

Analysis of Platelet Function Testing in Children Receiving Aspirin for Antiplatelet Effects.,"Aspirin (ASA) remains the most common antiplatelet agent used in children. VerifyNow Aspirin Test® (VN) assesses platelet response to ASA, with therapeutic effect defined by the manufacturer as ≤ 549 aspirin reaction units (ARU). Single-center, observational, analysis of 195 children (< 18 years-old) who underwent first VN between 2015 and 2020. Primary outcome was proportion of patients with ASA biochemical resistance (> 549 ARU). Secondary outcomes included incidence of new clinical thrombotic and bleeding events during ≤ 6 months from VN in those who received ASA monotherapy (n = 113). Median age was 1.8 years. Common indications for ASA included cardiac anomalies or dysfunction (74.8%) and ischemic stroke (22.6%). Median ASA dose before VN was 4.6 mg/kg/day. Mean VN was 471 ARU. ASA biochemical resistance was detected in 14.4% (n = 28). Of 113 patients receiving ASA monotherapy, 14 (12.4%) had a thrombotic event and 2 (1.8%) had a bleeding event. Mean VN was significantly higher at initial testing in patients experiencing thrombotic event compared to those without thrombosis (516 vs 465 ARU, [95% CI: 9.8, 92.2], p = 0.02). Multivariable analysis identified initial VN ASA result ≥ 500 ARU at initial testing as the only significant independent risk factor for thrombosis (p < 0.01). VN testing identifies ASA biochemical resistance in 14.4% of children. VN ASA ≥ 500 ARU rather than ≥ 550 ARU at initial testing was independently associated with increased odds of thrombosis. Designated cut-off of 550 ARU for detecting platelet dysfunction by ASA may need reconsideration in children.",2023,12,28
Captopril to Lisinopril Conversion in Pediatric Cardiothoracic Surgery Patients Less Than 7 Years of Age (RISE-7).,"Hypertension after cardiothoracic surgery is common, often requiring pharmacologic management. The recommended first-line antihypertensives in pediatrics are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Captopril and enalapril are approved for infants and children; however, lisinopril is only approved for > 7 years of age. This study evaluated safety and efficacy of converting from captopril to lisinopril in patients utilizing a pre-defined conversion of 3 mg captopril to 1 mg lisinopril. This was a single center, retrospective study including patients less than 7 years of age admitted for cardiothoracic surgery who received both captopril and lisinopril from 01/01/2017 to 06/01/2022.The primary outcome was mean change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline for 72 h after conversion of captopril to lisinopril. A total of 99 patients were enrolled. There was a significant decrease in mean SBP (99.12 mmHg vs 94.86 mmHg; p = 0.007) with no difference in DBP (59.23 mmHg vs 61.95 mmHg; p = 0.07) after conversion to lisinopril. Of the 99 patients who were transitioned to lisinopril, 79 (80%) had controlled SBP, 20 (20%) remained hypertensive, 13 (13%) received an increase in their lisinopril dose, and 2 (2%) required an additional antihypertensive agent. There was a low overall rate of AKI (3%) and hyperkalemia (4%) respectively. This study demonstrates that utilizing lisinopril with a conversion rate of 3 mg of captopril to 1 mg of lisinopril was safe and effective for controlling hypertension in pediatric patients following cardiothoracic surgery.",2023,12,28
Polyurethane-Degrading Potential of Alkaline Groundwater Bacteria.,"Plastic waste is a global environmental burden and long-lasting plastic polymers, including ubiquitous and toxic polyurethanes (PUs), rapidly accumulate in the water environments. In this study, samples were collected from the three alkaline groundwater occurrences in the geotectonic regions of the Pannonian basin of northern Serbia (Torda and Slankamen Banja) and Inner Dinarides of western Serbia (Mokra Gora) with aim to isolate and identify bacteria with plastic- and lignocellulose-degrading potential, that could be applied to reduce the burden of environmental plastic pollution. The investigated occurrences belong to cold, mildly alkaline (pH: 7.6-7.9) brackish and hyperalkaline (pH: 11.5) fresh groundwaters of the SO<sub>4</sub> - Na + K, Cl - Na + K and OH, Cl - Ca, Na + K genetic type. Full-length 16S rDNA sequencing, using Oxford Nanopore sequencing device, was performed with DNA extracted from colonies obtained by cultivation of all groundwater samples, as well as with DNA extracted directly from one groundwater sample. The most abundant genera belong to Pseudomonas, Acidovorax, Kocuria and Methylotenera. All screened isolates (100%) had the ability to grow on at least 3 of the tested plastic and lignocellulosic substrates, with 53.9% isolates degrading plastic substrate Impranil® DLN-SD (SD), a model compound for PUs degradation. Isolates degrading SD that were identified by partial 16S rDNA sequencing belong to the Stenotrophomonas, Pseudomonas, Paraburkholderia, Aeromonas, Vibrio and Acidovorax genera. Taking into account that plastics, including commonly produced PUs, are widespread in groundwater, identification of PUs-degrading bacteria may have potential applications in bioremediation of groundwater polluted with this polymer.",2023,12,28
NLRs and inflammasome signaling in opioid-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance.,"We investigated the role that innate immunological signaling pathways, principally nod-like receptors (NLRs) and inflammasomes, in the manifestation of the contradictory outcomes associated with opioids, namely hyperalgesia, and tolerance. The utilization of opioids for pain management is prevalent; nonetheless, it frequently leads to an increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) and reduced efficacy of the medication (tolerance) over an extended period. This, therefore, represents a major challenge in the area of chronic pain treatment. Recent studies indicate that the aforementioned negative consequences are partially influenced by the stimulation of NLRs, specifically the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the subsequent assembly of the inflammasome. This process ultimately results in the generation of inflammatory cytokines and the occurrence of neuroinflammation and the pathogenesis of hyperalgesia. We also explored the putative downstream signaling cascades activated by NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and inflammasomes in response to opioid stimuli. Furthermore, we probed potential therapeutic targets for modifying opioid-induced hyperalgesia, with explicit emphasis on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Ultimately, our findings underscore the significance of conducting additional research in this area that includes an examination of the involvement of various NLRs, immune cells, and genetic variables in the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance. The present review provides substantial insight into the possible pathways contributing to the occurrence of hyperalgesia and tolerance in individuals taking opioids.",2023,12,28

"A novel UV-resistant bacterium Sphingomonas endolithica sp. nov., and genomic analysis, isolated from the north slope of Mount Everest.","Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped, non-motile bacterium strain ZFBP2030<sup>T</sup> was isolated from a rock on the North slope of Mount Everest. This strain contained a unique ubiquinone-10 (Q-10) as a predominant respiratory quinone. Among the tested fatty acids, the strain contained summed feature 8, C<sub>14:0</sub> 2OH, and C<sub>16:0</sub>, as major cellular fatty acids. The polar lipid profile contained phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, three unidentified phospholipids, two unidentified aminolipids, and six unidentified lipids. The cell-wall peptidoglycan was a meso-diaminopimelic acid, and cell-wall sugars were ribose and galactose. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain ZFBP2030<sup>T</sup> was a member of the genus Sphingomonas, exhibiting high sequence similarity to the 16S rRNA gene sequences of Sphingomonas aliaeris DH-S5<sup>T</sup> (97.9%), Sphingomonas alpina DSM 22537<sup>T</sup> (97.3%) and Sphingomonas hylomeconis CCTCC AB 2013304<sup>T</sup> (97.0%). The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between ZFBP2030<sup>T</sup> and other typical strains was less than 97.0%. The average amino acid identity values, average nucleotide identity, and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain ZFBP2030<sup>T</sup> and its highest sequence similarity strains were 56.9-79.9%, 65.1-82.2%, and 19.3-25.8%, respectively. The whole-genome size of the novel strain ZFBP2030<sup>T</sup> was 4.1 Mbp, annotated with 3838 protein-coding genes and 54 RNA genes. Moreover, DNA G + C content was 64.7 mol%. Stress-related functions predicted in the subsystem classification of the strain ZFBP2030<sup>T</sup> genome included osmotic, oxidative, cold/heat shock, detoxification, and periplasmic stress responses. The overall results of this study clearly showed that strain ZFBP2030<sup>T</sup> is a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas endolithica sp. nov. is proposed. The type of strain is ZFBP2030<sup>T</sup> (= EE 013<sup>T</sup> = GDMCC 1.3123<sup>T</sup> = JCM 35386<sup>T</sup>).",2023,12,28
UiO66-based molecularly imprinted polymers with water-compatible deep eutectic solvent as functional monomer for purification of lysozyme from egg white.,"Protein-templated molecularly imprinted polymers have limitations such as poor mass transfer, slow recognition kinetics, and difficulties in isolation and purification due to their large molecular sizes, complex structures, and flexible conformations. To address these limitations and obtain lysozyme (Lyz)-imprinted polymers, a molecularly imprinted polymer (UiO66@DES-MIPs) was prepared for the first time by using Lyz as a template molecule, a metal-organic framework (UiO66-NH<sub>2</sub>) as a matrix, and a water-compatible deep eutectic solvent (DES) as a functional monomer. The introduction of UiO66-NH<sub>2</sub> by the solvothermal method with a large specific surface area and favorable stability and resistance to environmental disturbances into the MIPs can reduce the ""embedding"" phenomenon and acquire a higher binding capacity and fast mass transfer. In addition, a water-soluble binary DES (1:2 molar ratio of choline chloride to 1,3 dimethylurea) prepared by a hydrothermal method as a functional monomer generates multiple forces with Lyz, increasing the hydrophilicity of UiO66@DES-MIPs and contributing to the formation and stabilization of the imprinted sites. Consequently, UiO66@DES-MIPs exhibited good selectivity, water compatibility, and fast adsorption equilibrium (the adsorption equilibrated at 243.87 ± 4.88 mg g<sup>-1</sup> in 90 min). Besides, reusability experiments indicated that the UiO66@DES-MIPs could be recycled six times without obvious loss of adsorption capacity. The imprinting factor of UiO66@DES-MIPs is 3.67. The isolation and purification of Lyz from egg white confirmed the practicability of UiO66@DES-MIPs. The high adsorption capacity and specific recognition make this polymer a promising candidate for the isolation and purification of biological macromolecules.",2023,12,28
"Does time heal all wounds? An investigation of time, grief, and attitudes toward death.","When experiencing the loss of a loved one, individuals adapt and change how they understand death, how they interpret the meaning of the loss, and how they remember the deceased. In the present study (<i>N</i> = 164), we investigated whether the time since the loss - recent or distant - was associated with individuals' bereavement, attitudes toward death, and their meaning of death. We found that individuals who experienced a recent loss reported more grief and more negative death attitudes compared to individuals who experienced a loss more than 5 years ago. Moreover, the bereavement appeared to completely mediate the time since the loss and the individuals' attitudes about death. The findings suggest that time-dependent adaptations after a loss shifts individuals' death attitudes, grief symptoms, and thoughts about death.",2023,12,28

The ability and optimal cutoff value of serum cell division cycle 42 in estimating major adverse cardiac event in STEMI patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention.,"Cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) regulates cholesterol efflux, chronic inflammation, and reendothelialization in various atherosclerotic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the correlation of serum CDC42 with myocardial injury indicators and major adverse cardiac event (MACE) in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients who were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In 250 STEMI patients about to receive PCI, serum samples were collected at enrollment before PCI treatment, and the serum samples were also obtained from 100 healthy controls (HCs) at enrollment. Serum CDC42 was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum CDC42 was decreased (versus HCs, P < 0.001) and negatively correlated with diabetes mellitus (P = 0.017), multivessel disease (P = 0.016), cardiac troponin I (P < 0.001), creatine kinase MB (P = 0.012), stent diameter ≥ 3.5 mm (P = 0.039), white blood cell (P < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.049), and C-reactive protein (P < 0.001) in STEMI patients. Besides, 29 (11.6%) STEMI patients experienced MACE. The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year accumulating MACE rates were 7.5%, 17.3%, and 19.3%, accordingly. Serum CDC42 was reduced in STEMI patients who experienced MACE compared to those who did not (P = 0.001). Serum CDC42 ≥ 250 pg/mL, ≥ 400 pg/mL, ≥ 700 pg/mL (cut by near integer value of 1/4th quartile, median, and 3/4th quartile) were associated with decreased accumulating MACE rates in STEMI patients (all P < 0.050). Notably, serum CDC42 ≥ 250 pg/mL (hazard ratio = 0.435, P = 0.031) was independently related to reduced accumulating MACE risk in STEMI patients. A serum CDC42 level of ≥ 250 pg/mL well predicts decreased MACE risk in STEMI patients who are treated with PCI.",2023,12,28
"Expression of CD31, CD34, and smooth muscle actin (SMA) in endothelial cells of dental pulp vessels.","The dental pulp is a highly vascularized and innervated loose connective tissue surrounded by hard dental tissues - enamel and dentine. With the primary dentin formation and the closure of the root apex, the conditions in the dental pulp change and pulp tissue compliance are reduced. Endothelial cells of pulpal blood vessels are highly differentiated and are capable of adaptation to changes in the environment. We aimed to evaluate the phenotypic plasticity of endothelial cells of pulpal blood vessels in permanent premolars with open (N = 6) or closed root apex (N = 30). The pulp tissue was stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) for the histological analysis, and immunohistochemically for a cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31), a cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34), and for smooth muscle actin (SMA) to detect vessels with CD31, CD34, and SMA positive endothelial cells. We used the student's t-test and Pearson correlation test for the statistical analysis. We found a significantly higher percentage of the vessels with CD31 (P = 0.005) and CD34 (P = 0.000) positive endothelial cells in the group of teeth with closed root apex compared to the group with open apex. A significant positive correlation between SMA positive and CD31 positive vessels (P = 0.003) and between CD31 positive and CD34 positive vessels (P = 0.031) was also found. We conclude that the endothelial cells of dental pulp vessels express a small amount of CD31, but have a pronounced expression of SMA and CD34, which indicates their progenitor potential and contractile ability.",2023,12,28
Perspectives on Theoretical Models and Molecular Simulations of Polymer Brushes.,"Polymer brushes have witnessed extensive utilization and progress, driven by their distinct attributes in surface modification, tethered group functionality, and tailored interactions at the nanoscale, enabling them for various scientific and industrial applications of coatings, sensors, switchable/responsive materials, nanolithography, and lab-on-a-chips. Despite the wealth of experimental investigations into polymer brushes, this review primarily focuses on computational studies of antifouling polymer brushes with a strong emphasis on achieving a molecular-level understanding and structurally designing antifouling polymer brushes. Computational exploration covers three realms of thermotical models, molecular simulations, and machine-learning approaches to elucidate the intricate relationship between composition, structure, and properties concerning polymer brushes in the context of nanotribology, surface hydration, and packing conformation. Upon acknowledging the challenges currently faced, we extend our perspectives toward future research directions by delineating potential avenues and unexplored territories. Our overarching objective is to advance our foundational comprehension and practical utilization of polymer brushes for antifouling applications, leveraging the synergy between computational methods and materials design to drive innovation in this crucial field.",2023,12,28
C-C Motif Chemokine 2 Regulates Macrophage Polarization and Contributes to Myocardial Infarction Healing.,"Macrophages are crucial immune cells that play essential roles in the healing of myocardial infarction (MI), undergoing continuous polarization throughout this process. C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2) is a chemokine that regulates inflammatory responses during MI. However, the extent to which CCL2 influences macrophage polarization and MI healing remains incompletely understood. In this study, we investigate the role of CCL2 in macrophage polarization and MI healing. Our findings reveal that CCL2 is differentially expressed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced M1 and interleukin (IL)-4-induced M2 RAW264.7 macrophages. Knockdown of CCL2 attenuates TNF-α secretion stimulated by LPS, while overexpression of CCL2 mitigates IL-10 production triggered by IL-4 in these macrophages. Moreover, CCL2 deficiency disrupts LPS-induced M1 polarization, whereas CCL2 overexpression reduces M2 polarization of RAW264.7 macrophages induced by IL-4. Further exploration indicates that the promotion of M1 polarization by CCL2 is significantly impaired by inhibition of the p38-mediated MAPK pathway and NF-κB pathway. In a MI mouse model, CCL2 knockdown remarkably reduces infarct size, collagen synthesis, and the expression of cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy markers. The activity of the p38-mediated MAPK pathway and NF-κB pathway is downregulated by CCL2 knockdown as well. Additionally, the number of total macrophages and M1 macrophages in the infarct decreases, while the number of M2 macrophages increases upon CCL2 deficiency. In conclusion, these results suggest that CCL2 is a key regulator of macrophage polarization, controlling MI healing <i>in vivo</i>.",2023,12,28
Active Social Media Use and Health Indicators Among Sexual and Gender Minority Adults.,"<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals may receive social support through active use of social media (i.e., posting and interacting). This study examined associations between active social media use, social support, and health indicators in a large sample of SGM adults in the United States. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Data were derived from the 2017 wave of The PRIDE Study, a national cohort study of SGM health. SGM-identified adults reporting social media use (<i>N</i> = 5995) completed measures of active social media use, social support, depressive symptoms, cigarette smoking, hazardous drinking, sleep, and physical activity. Regression models examined main and interactive effects of active social media use and social support on health indicators. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The sample reported a moderate level of active social media use (mean [<i>M</i>] = 3.2 [1.0], scale = 1-5) and relatively high social support (<i>M</i> = 16.7 [3.3], scale = 4-20); 31.8% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Participants with greater active social media use were more likely to experience depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-1.26), cigarette smoking (AOR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.01-1.22), insufficient sleep (AOR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.06-1.21), and physical inactivity (AOR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.02-1.15) than those with less active social media use. Active social media use did not significantly interact with social support to predict any health indicators (<i>p</i> values >0.159). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Among SGM adults, active social media use was associated with several negative health indicators. Active social media use may increase health risks, or SGM adults with poor health may actively use social media to maintain social connections. Moderate active social media use may be compatible with health.",2023,12,28
"Design and construction of novel pyridine-pyrimidine hybrids as selective COX-2 suppressors: anti-inflammatory potential, ulcerogenic profile, molecular modeling and ADME/Tox studies.","NSAIDs represent a mainstay in pain and inflammation suppression, and their actions are mainly based on inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.Due to the adverse effects of these drugs, especially on the stomach and heart, scientists efforts have been directed to manufacture selective COX-2 without cardiovascular side effects and with minimal effects on the stomach. The cardiovascular side effects are thought to be related to the chemical composition rather than mechanism of action of these drugs.Novel pyridopyrimidines, 9a-j, were prepared and their chemical structures were confirmed by NMR, mass and IR Spectra, and elemental analysis. The effect of the 9a-j compounds on COX-1 and COX-2 was assessed and it was found that 2-hydrazino-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-7-phenyl-3<i>H</i>-pyrido[2,3-<i>d</i>)pyrimidin-4-one (<b>9d</b>) was the most potent COX-2 inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.54 <i>u</i>M) compared to celecoxib (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.11 <i>u</i>M) with selectivity indices of 6.56 and 5.12, respectively.The <i>in vivo</i> inhibition of paw edema of novel compounds 9a-j was measured using carrageenan-induced paw edema method, and that 2-hydrazino-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-7-phenyl-3<i>H</i>-pyrido[2,3-<i>d</i>)pyrimidin-4-one (<b>9d</b>) showed the best inhibitory activity in comparison with the other compounds and celecoxib.The gastroprotective effect of the potent derivatives 9d, 9e, 9f, 9 g and 9h was investigated. 2-Hydrazino-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-7-phenyl-3<i>H</i>-pyrido[2,3-<i>d</i>)pyrimidin-4-one (<b>9d</b>) and 7-(chlorophenyl)-hydrazino-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3<i>H</i>-pyrido[2,3-<i>d</i>)pyrimidin-4-one (<b>9e</b>) showed ulcer indices comparable to celecoxib (1 and 0.5 vs 0.5, respectively).

Regulation of Cellular-Signaling Pathways by Mammalian Proteins Containing Bacterial EPIYA or EPIYA-Like Motifs Predicted to be Phosphorylated.,"The effector proteins of several pathogenic bacteria contain the Glu-Pro-Ile-<u>Tyr</u>-Ala (EPI<u>Y</u>A) motif or other similar motifs. The EPIYA motif is delivered into the host cells by type III and IV secretion systems, through which its tyrosine residue undergoes phosphorylation by host kinases. These motifs atypically interact with a wide range of Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing mammalian proteins through tyrosine phosphorylation, which leads to the perturbation of multiple signaling cascades, the spread of infection, and improved bacterial colonization. Interestingly, it has been reported that EPIYA (or EPIYA-like) motifs exist in mammalian proteomes and regulate mammalian cellular-signaling pathways, leading to homeostasis and disease pathophysiology. It is possible that pathogenic bacteria have exploited EPIYA (or EPIYA-like) motifs from mammalian proteins and that the mammalian EPIYA (or EPIYA-like) motifs have evolved to have highly specific interactions with SH2 domain-containing proteins. In this review, we focus on the regulation of mammalian cellular-signaling pathways by mammalian proteins containing these motifs.",2023,12,28
Cost-Effectiveness of second-line lisocabtagene maraleucel in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,"Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel), a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, received FDA approval in 2022 for second-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in patients with refractory disease or early relapse following first-line chemoimmuno-therapy. This decision was influenced by the TRANSFORM study demonstrating improvements in event-free survival with liso-cel compared to standard care. Given the substantial costs associat-ed with CAR T-cell therapies, particularly as they transition to second-line treatment, a cost-effectiveness analysis is essential to accurately determine their economic viability. The study em-ployed a partitioned survival model using standard parametric functions over a lifetime horizon to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of liso-cel versus platinum-based chemotherapy followed by autolo-gous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Integrating data from the TRANSFORM and TRANSCEND trials, along with established literature and public datasets, the study calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). For a representative cohort of 60-year-old US adults, liso-cel's ICER was $99,669 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from a healthcare sector perspective and $68,212 per QALY from a societal perspective, confirming its cost-effectiveness at $100,000 per QALY threshold. Nonetheless, under certain scenarios, liso-cel surpasses this benchmark but remains within the US acceptable range of $150,000 per QALY. This study is the first to analyze liso-cel's cost-effectiveness as a second-line therapy. A key finding underlines the importance of incorporating productivity losses into such analyses to capture the broader societal values of novel therapies. The study reveals that although these therapies offer substantial clinical benefits, their high acquisition costs and limited long-term data critically challenge their economic sustainability.",2023,12,28
Self-Organized States from Solutions of Active Ring Polymers in Bulk and under Confinement.,"In the present work, we study, by means of numerical simulations, the structural and dynamical behavior of a suspension of active ring polymers in bulk and under lateral confinement. At high activity, when changing the distance between the confining planes and the polymers' density, we identify the emergence of a self-organized dynamical state, characterized by the coexistence of slowly diffusing clusters of rotating disks and faster rings moving in between them. We further assess that self-organization is robust in a range of polymer sizes, and we identify a critical value of the activity, necessary to trigger cluster formation. This system has distinctive features resembling at the same time polymers, liquid crystals, and active systems, where the interplay between activity, topology, and confinement leads to a spontaneous segregation in an initially one-component solution.",2023,12,28

Continued dysfunction of capillary pericytes promotes no-reflow after experimental stroke in vivo.,"Incomplete reperfusion of the microvasculature ('no-reflow') after ischaemic stroke damages salvageable brain tissue. Previous ex vivo studies suggest pericytes are vulnerable to ischaemia and may exacerbate no-reflow, but the viability of pericytes and their association with no-reflow remains under-explored in vivo. Using longitudinal in vivo two-photon single-cell imaging over 7 days, we showed that 87% of pericytes constrict during cerebral ischaemia and remain constricted post reperfusion, and 50% of the pericyte population are acutely damaged. Moreover, we revealed ischaemic pericytes to be fundamentally implicated in capillary no-reflow by limiting and arresting blood flow within the first 24 h post stroke. Despite sustaining acute membrane damage, we observed that over half of all cortical pericytes survived ischaemia and responded to vasoactive stimuli, upregulated unique transcriptomic profiles and replicated. Finally, we demonstrated the delayed recovery of capillary diameter by ischaemic pericytes after reperfusion predicted vessel reconstriction in the subacute phase of stroke. Cumulatively, these findings demonstrate that surviving cortical pericytes remain both viable and promising therapeutic targets to counteract no-reflow after ischaemic stroke.",2023,12,28
"Magnitude and Correlates of Symptomatic, Global Illness, and Social Functioning Response; Out-of-Home Placement; and Length of Stay in 1,189 Consecutively Hospitalized Children and Adolescents With Mental Disorders.","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To identify outcome predictors in hospitalized youth with mental disorders. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This retrospective analysis of systematically recorded clinical parameters in youth hospitalized for psychiatric treatment in 2004-2015 assessed magnitude and correlates of symptom response (SR), global illness response (GIR), social functioning (SF), out-of-home placement (OOHP), and length of stay (LOS).

In multivariable analyses, 11 factors were statistically significantly (<i>P</i> < .05) associated with > 1 poor outcome: 4 with 4 outcomes (disturbed social interaction, substance abuse/dependence symptoms; sole exception for both = LOS; disturbed drive/attention/impulse control, sole exception = OOHP; higher admission BMI percentile [but shorter LOS], sole exception = GIR), 3 with 3 outcomes (higher admission age [but good SF and shorter LOS], more abnormal psychosocial circumstances, more mental health diagnoses), and 4 with 2 outcomes (intelligence level [IQ] < 85, obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms, disturbed social behavior, somatic findings). Additionally, 17 correlates were statistically significantly (<i>P</i> < .05) associated with 1 outcome, ie, SR = 6, OOHP = 5, LOS = 5, SF = 1. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Higher admission BMI percentile, disturbed social interaction, disturbed drive/attention/impulse control, and substance abuse/dependence symptoms were independently associated with multiple poor outcomes in mentally ill youth requiring inpatient care. Knowledge of global and specific correlates of poor inpatient treatment outcomes may help inform treatment decisions.",2023,12,27

Computational modeling of cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis.,"The complexity of cardiac electrophysiology, involving dynamic changes in numerous components across multiple spatial (from ion channel to organ) and temporal (from milliseconds to days) scales makes an intuitive or empirical analysis of cardiac arrhythmogenesis challenging. Multiscale mechanistic computational models of cardiac electrophysiology provide precise control over individual parameters, and their reproducibility enables a thorough assessment of arrhythmia mechanisms. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of models of cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmias. from the single cell to the organ level, and how they can be leveraged to better understand rhythm disorders in cardiac disease and to improve heart patient care. Key issues related to model development based on experimental data are discussed and major families of human cardiomyocyte models and their applications are highlighted. An overview of organ-level computational modeling of cardiac electrophysiology and its clinical applications in personalized arrhythmia risk assessment and patient-specific therapy of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias is provided. The advancements presented here highlight how patient-specific computational models of the heart reconstructed from patient clinical data have achieved success in predicting risk of sudden cardiac death and guiding optimal treatments of heart rhythm disorders. Finally, an outlook towards potential future advances, including the combination of mechanistic modeling and machine learning / artificial intelligence, is provided. As the field of cardiology is embarking on a journey towards precision medicine, personalized modeling of the heart is expected to become a key technology to guide pharmaceutical therapy, deployment of devices, and surgical interventions.",2023,12,28
Techno-functional attributes of oilseed proteins: influence of extraction and modification techniques.,"Plant-based protein isolates and concentrates are nowadays becoming popular due to their nutritional, functional as well as religious concerns. Among plant proteins, oilseeds, a vital source of valuable proteins, are continuously being explored for producing protein isolates/concentrates. This article delineates the overview of conventional as well as novel methods for the extraction of protein and their potential impact on its hydration, surface properties, and rheological characteristics. Moreover, proteins undergo several modifications using physical, chemical, and biological techniques to enhance their functionality by altering their microstructure and physical performance. The modified proteins hold a pronounced scope in novel food formulations. An overview of these protein modification approaches and their effects on the functional properties of proteins have also been presented in this review.",2023,12,28

A Brief Review and Case Report.,"Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus is a rare adnexal hamartoma characterized by the presence of a cornoid lamella exclusively overlying eccrine acrosyringia. Different clinical presentations have been reported in the literature. Here, we report a case of a 6-year-old girl diagnosed with porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus confirmed by histopathologic study. Atypical lesions are described as whitish, warty-looking neoformations located in the anterolateral region of the right hip (cutaneous horn).",2023,12,26
Localized Cutaneous Argyria at the Site of a Prior Melanoma Excision Confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy With Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis.,"Localized cutaneous argyria is a rare condition caused by the accumulation of silver particles in the skin, leading to blue-gray discoloration. Argyria may mimic melanoma and lead to misdiagnosis. We present a patient with a history of melanoma that developed a blue-gray nodule at a prior melanoma graft. The diagnosis was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. These techniques differentiate argyria from melanoma and can be performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, tissue sections. Health care providers should be alert that argyria may mimic recurrent melanoma in patients unaware of silver exposure.",2023,12,26
Variable antiviral activity of islatravir against M184I/V mutant HIV-1 selected during antiretroviral therapy.,"Islatravir is a new antiretroviral drug that inhibits the reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV-1 through multiple mechanisms. It is proposed to be used in combination with doravirine, a new NNRTI. M184V/I mutations have been shown to reduce the in vitro antiviral activity of islatravir, but their effect when pre-selected during ART has not been investigated.",2023,12,28
Cellular Ligand-Receptor Perturbations Unravel MEIS2 as a Key Factor for the Aggressive Progression and Prognosis in Stage II/III Colorectal Cancer.,"Approximately 10-15% of stage II and 25-30% of stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients experience recurrence within 5 years after surgery, and existing taxonomies are insufficient to meet the needs of clinical precision treatment. Thus, robust biomarkers and precise management were urgently required to stratify stage II and III CRC and identify potential patients who will benefit from postoperative adjuvant therapy. Alongside, interactions of ligand-receptor pairs point to an emerging direction in tumor signaling with far-reaching implications for CRC, while their impact on tumor subtyping has not been elucidated. Herein, based on multiple large-sample multicenter cohorts and perturbations of the ligand-receptor interaction network, four well-characterized ligand-receptor-driven subtypes (LRDS) were established and further validated. These molecular taxonomies perform with unique heterogeneity in terms of molecular characteristics, immune and mutational landscapes, and clinical features. Specifically, <i>MEIS2</i>, a key LRDS4 factor, performs significant associations with proliferation, invasion, migration, and dismal prognosis of stage II/III CRC, revealing promising directions for prognostic assessment and individualized treatment of CRC patients. Overall, our study sheds novel insights into the implications of intercellular communication on stage II/III CRC from a ligand-receptor interactome perspective and revealed <i>MEIS2</i> as a key factor in the aggressive progression and prognosis for stage II/III CRC.",2023,12,28
Specialized and versatile antisocial behavioral profiles in preschoolers: Associations with persistent behavioral problems.,"This study investigated specialized and versatile antisocial patterns in preschoolers and examined the link between these patterns and the risk of developing chronic antisocial behaviors throughout childhood. A total of 556 children (50.6% boys, 88% White) participated in this three-wave longitudinal study at 3-5, 6-8, and 10-12 years old. A latent transition analysis revealed that most preschoolers (89.5%) who adopt several subtypes of antisocial behaviors simultaneously exhibit stable and severe antisocial behaviors throughout childhood. In contrast, most preschoolers (60%) who favor one specific subtype of antisocial behaviors desist from such behaviors between preschool and preadolescence. Importantly, aggression accompanied by other subtypes of antisocial behaviors predicted chronicity better than aggression alone, casting doubt on the notion that aggression is the strongest predictor of chronicity.",2023,12,28
Risk factors contributing to postoperative surgical site infections in patients undergoing ankle fracture fixation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Surgical site infections (SSIs) following ankle fracture fixation pose significant challenges in patient recovery and healthcare management. Identifying risk factors contributing to SSIs can aid in developing targeted prevention and treatment strategies. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and the PICO framework. A comprehensive literature search across major databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, was completed on September 26, 2023. The inclusion criteria encompassed peer-reviewed studies of various designs that investigated risk factors for SSIs post-ankle fracture fixation. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Statistical analyses assessed heterogeneity and calculated combined effect sizes using fixed- or random-effects models, depending on the heterogeneity observed. The initial search yielded 1250 articles, with seven meeting the inclusion criteria after rigorous screening and full-text review. The included studies, conducted between 2006 and 2019, predominantly utilized case-control designs. The meta-analysis identified diabetes, open fractures, smoking, age, alcohol consumption, ASA score ≥3, high BMI, contaminated incisions, fracture dislocation and heart disease as significant risk factors for postoperative SSIs. Publication bias assessment showed no significant bias across studies. The identification of key risk factors such as diabetes, open fractures, smoking, advanced age, alcohol consumption, high ASA score, elevated BMI, contaminated incisions, fracture dislocation and heart disease is essential in managing SSIs post-ankle fracture fixation. Targeted interventions addressing these risk factors are crucial to reduce the incidence of SSIs and improve overall patient outcomes.",2023,12,28
Genomic footprints of (pre) colonialism: Population declines in urban and forest túngara frogs coincident with historical human activity.,"Urbanisation is rapidly altering ecosystems, leading to profound biodiversity loss. To mitigate these effects, we need a better understanding of how urbanisation impacts dispersal and reproduction. Two contrasting population demographic models have been proposed that predict that urbanisation either promotes (facilitation model) or constrains (fragmentation model) gene flow and genetic diversity. Which of these models prevails likely depends on the strength of selection on specific phenotypic traits that influence dispersal, survival, or reproduction. Here, we a priori examined the genomic impact of urbanisation on the Neotropical túngara frog (Engystomops pustulosus), a species known to adapt its reproductive traits to urban selective pressures. Using whole-genome resequencing for multiple urban and forest populations we examined genomic diversity, population connectivity and demographic history. Contrary to both the fragmentation and facilitation models, urban populations did not exhibit substantial changes in genomic diversity or differentiation compared with forest populations, and genomic variation was best explained by geographic distance rather than environmental factors. Adopting an a posteriori approach, we additionally found both urban and forest populations to have undergone population declines. The timing of these declines appears to coincide with extensive human activity around the Panama Canal during the last few centuries rather than recent urbanisation. Our study highlights the long-lasting legacy of past anthropogenic disturbances in the genome and the importance of considering the historical context in urban evolution studies as anthropogenic effects may be extensive and impact nonurban areas on both recent and older timescales.",2023,12,28
"Phenotypic plasticity for improved light harvesting, in tandem with methylome repatterning in reef-building corals.","Acclimatization through phenotypic plasticity represents a more rapid response to environmental change than adaptation and is vital to optimize organisms' performance in different conditions. Generally, animals are less phenotypically plastic than plants, but reef-building corals exhibit plant-like properties. They are light dependent with a sessile and modular construction that facilitates rapid morphological changes within their lifetime. We induced phenotypic changes by altering light exposure in a reciprocal transplant experiment and found that coral plasticity is a colony trait emerging from comprehensive morphological and physiological changes within the colony. Plasticity in skeletal features optimized coral light harvesting and utilization and paralleled significant methylome and transcriptome modifications. Network-associated responses resulted in the identification of hub genes and clusters associated to the change in phenotype: inter-partner recognition and phagocytosis, soft tissue growth and biomineralization. Furthermore, we identified hub genes putatively involved in animal photoreception-phototransduction. These findings fundamentally advance our understanding of how reef-building corals repattern the methylome and adjust a phenotype, revealing an important role of light sensing by the coral animal to optimize photosynthetic performance of the symbionts.",2023,12,28
A CRISPR-based strategy for targeted sequencing in biodiversity science.,"Many applications in molecular ecology require the ability to match specific DNA sequences from single- or mixed-species samples with a diagnostic reference library. Widely used methods for DNA barcoding and metabarcoding employ PCR and amplicon sequencing to identify taxa based on target sequences, but the target-specific enrichment capabilities of CRISPR-Cas systems may offer advantages in some applications. We identified 54,837 CRISPR-Cas guide RNAs that may be useful for enriching chloroplast DNA across phylogenetically diverse plant species. We tested a subset of 17 guide RNAs in vitro to enrich plant DNA strands ranging in size from diagnostic DNA barcodes of 1,428 bp to entire chloroplast genomes of 121,284 bp. We used an Oxford Nanopore sequencer to evaluate sequencing success based on both single- and mixed-species samples, which yielded mean chloroplast sequence lengths of 2,530-11,367 bp, depending on the experiment. In comparison to mixed-species experiments, single-species experiments yielded more on-target sequence reads and greater mean pairwise identity between contigs and the plant species' reference genomes. But nevertheless, these mixed-species experiments yielded sufficient data to provide ≥48-fold increase in sequence length and better estimates of relative abundance for a commercially prepared mixture of plant species compared to DNA metabarcoding based on the chloroplast trnL-P6 marker. Prior work developed CRISPR-based enrichment protocols for long-read sequencing and our experiments pioneered its use for plant DNA barcoding and chloroplast assemblies that may have advantages over workflows that require PCR and short-read sequencing. Future work would benefit from continuing to develop in vitro and in silico methods for CRISPR-based analyses of mixed-species samples, especially when the appropriate reference genomes for contig assembly cannot be known a priori.",2023,12,28
BG4 antibody can recognize telomeric G-quadruplexes harboring destabilizing base modifications and lesions.,"BG4 is a single-chain variable fragment antibody shown to bind various G-quadruplex (GQ) topologies with high affinity and specificity, and to detect GQ in cells, including GQ structures formed within telomeric TTAGGG repeats. Here, we used ELISA and single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) detection to test how various lengths and GQ destabilizing base modifications in telomeric DNA constructs alter BG4 binding. We observed high-affinity BG4 binding to telomeric GQ independent of telomere length, although three telomeric repeat constructs that cannot form stable intramolecular GQ showed reduced affinity. A single guanine substitution with 8-aza-7-deaza-G, T, A, or C reduced affinity to varying degrees depending on the location and base type, whereas two G substitutions in the telomeric construct dramatically reduced or abolished binding. Substitution with damaged bases 8-oxoguanine and O6-methylguanine failed to prevent BG4 binding although affinity was reduced depending on lesion location. SiMPull combined with FRET revealed that BG4 binding promotes folding of telomeric GQ harboring a G to T substitution or 8-oxoguanine. Atomic force microscopy revealed that BG4 binds telomeric GQ with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Collectively, our data suggest that BG4 can recognize partially folded telomeric GQ structures and promote telomeric GQ stability.",2023,12,28
A novel single-base deletional mutation of MIP impairs protein distribution and cell-to-cell adhesion in autosomal dominant cataracts in a Chinese family.,"Congenital cataracts are the leading cause of irreversible visual disability in children, and genetic factors play an important role in their development. In this study, targeted exome sequencing revealed a novel single-base deletional mutation of MIP (c.301delG; p.Ala101Profs*16) segregated with congenital punctate cataract in a Chinese family. The hydrophobic properties, and secondary and tertiary structures for truncated MIP were predicted to affect the function of protein by bioinformatics analysis. When MIP-WT and MIP-Ala101fs expression constructs were singly transfected into HeLa cells, it was found that the mRNA level showed no significant difference, while the protein level of the mutant was remarkably reduced compared to that of the wild-type MIP. Immunofluorescence images showed that the MIP-WT was principally localized to the plasma membrane, whereas the MIP-Ala101fs protein was aberrantly trapped in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the cell-to-cell adhesion capability and the cell-to-cell communication property were both significantly reduced for MIP-Ala101fs compared to the MIP-WT (all *p < 0.05). This is the first report of the c.301delG mutation in the MIP gene associated with autosomal dominant congenital cataracts. We propose that the cataract is caused by the decreased protein expression and reduced cell-to-cell adhesion by the mutant MIP. The impaired trafficking or instability of the mutant protein, as well as compromised intercellular communication is probably a concurrent result of the mutation. The results expand the genetic and phenotypic spectra of MIP and help to better understand the molecular basis of congenital cataracts.",2023,12,28
Lethal perturbation of an Escherichia coli regulatory network is triggered by a restriction-modification system's regulator and can be mitigated by excision of the cryptic prophage Rac.,"Bacterial gene regulatory networks orchestrate responses to environmental challenges. Horizontal gene transfer can bring in genes with regulatory potential, such as new transcription factors (TFs), and this can disrupt existing networks. Serious regulatory perturbations may even result in cell death. Here, we show the impact on Escherichia coli of importing a promiscuous TF that has adventitious transcriptional effects within the cryptic Rac prophage. A cascade of regulatory network perturbations occurred on a global level. The TF, a C regulatory protein, normally controls a Type II restriction-modification system, but in E. coli K-12 interferes with expression of the RacR repressor gene, resulting in de-repression of the normally-silent Rac ydaT gene. YdaT is a prophage-encoded TF with pleiotropic effects on E. coli physiology. In turn, YdaT alters expression of a variety of bacterial regulons normally controlled by the RcsA TF, resulting in deficient lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and cell division. At the same time, insufficient RacR repressor results in Rac DNA excision, halting Rac gene expression due to loss of the replication-defective Rac prophage. Overall, Rac induction appears to counteract the lethal toxicity of YdaT. We show here that E. coli rewires its regulatory network, so as to minimize the adverse regulatory effects of the imported C TF. This complex set of interactions may reflect the ability of bacteria to protect themselves by having robust mechanisms to maintain their regulatory networks, and/or suggest that regulatory C proteins from mobile operons are under selection to manipulate their host's regulatory networks for their own benefit.",2023,12,28
Toxicity assessment of perovskite nanocomposites: In vivo study.,"Perovskite solar cells display potential as a renewable energy source because of their high-power conversion efficiency. However, there is limited understanding regarding the potential impact of perovskite on human health and the ecosystem. In this study, two sets of male Wistar albino rats received 35 injections of perovskite composite at a dosage of 0.372 mg/kg body weight. The animals underwent thorough examinations, encompassing morphometric, hematological, biochemical, histological, and behavioral analyses. Liver, kidney, and testis biopsies were processed and examined histologically. Additionally, two groups of mice (perovskite-treated and control mice, each with <i>n</i> = 10) underwent three behavioral tests: the Elevated Zero Maze test, Marble Burying test, and Light-Dark Box test. Perovskite-treated rats displayed a significant increase in levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, triglycerides, cholesterol, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, white blood cells, and platelets. However, total bilirubin levels decreased, with no significant alteration in albumin values. Furthermore, exposure to perovskite composite resulted in a slight decrease in lactate dehydrogenase and red blood cell count. Histopathological examination revealed hepatic hydropic degeneration, Kupffer cells hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and renal hydropic degeneration, while testicular tissues remained unaffected. Moreover, behavioral changes were observed in perovskite-treated mice, including depression, anxiety, and compulsive burying activity. These findings suggest that exposure to perovskite can lead to significant hematological and biochemical changes, as well as hepatorenal histopathological alterations and behavioral changes. Additionally, chronic exposure to perovskite materials may induce structural and functional alterations in vital organs.",2023,12,28
Usefulness of inclusion of ertapenem and temocillin screening breakpoints in the EUCAST rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (RAST) for rapid detection of OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae directly from positive blood cultures.,The aims of this study were: (i) to assess the ability of the meropenem screening breakpoint as part of the screening rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (sRAST) of EUCAST for the detection of OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae directly from positive blood cultures (BCs); and (ii) to evaluate the inclusion of ertapenem and temocillin discs into the sRAST to enhance the detection of OXA-48-producing isolates.,2023,12,28
Neonatal manifestation of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome - four case reports and a mini-literature review.,"A genetic disorder caused by the microdeletion of the long arm of 22th chromosome is the most common microdeletion syndrome in humans. It is estimated that 22q11.2 deletion affects one in every 1,000 foetales and one in 4,000 live births. During the neonatal period, the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome manifests itself in children in the form of dysmorphic facial features, and the results of ultrasound imaging tests reveal thymus hypoplasia, urinary tract disorders or brain impairments. The picture is completed by congenital heart diseases which indicate a high probability of the syndrome. This report describes four cases of newborns with 22q11.2 syndrome, presenting with a variety of clinical findings typical for this genetic disorder. The patients present symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening conditions. The severity of the congenital heart defect determines the survival rate in infancy. Each needs of each patient must be tailored to his or her specific medical problems. A holistic approach, addressing medical and behavioural needs, can be very helpful.",2023,05,17

"Relationship between eating patterns and emotional distress, and perceived quality of life in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.","Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine disorder with numerous hormonal, metabolic, and reproductive manifestations. Because of the variety of adverse consequences associated with the condition, women with PCOS suffer emotional distress, resulting in reduced health-related quality of life. Similar to other chronic conditions, eating patterns have been shown effective in impacting the quality of life of PCOS patients. Therefore, lifestyle modifications are recommended as a first-line therapy for PCOS, before prescribing any pharmaceutical management of the PCOS. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between dietary patterns, emotional distress, and perceived quality of life in women with diagnosed PCOS.",2023,08,11
Gelatin medium for preserving of Trichinella spp. for quality control in laboratories - estimation of larvae viability.,"Official food control laboratories ensure food safety using reliable, validated methods. Council Regulations (EC) No. 853/2004, 854/2004 and 882/2004 of the European Parliament established hygiene rules the production of food of animal origin, together with requirements for official controls. This leads to detailed requirements for <i>Trichinella</i> control set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1375 of 10 August 2015. These regulations require the laboratory to participate in proficiency testing (PT) to confirm their competence and improve the quality of testing, and require the PT Organizer to use methods for the preparation and preservation of parasite larvae in order to evaluate and improve detection.

Local Legislation is Associated With Regional Transgender Attitudes.,"Using a newly developed measure of implicit transgender attitudes, we investigate the association between state-level antitransgender policies and individual-level attitudes about transgender people among residents. In a large sample of U.S. participants (<i>N</i> = 211,133), we find that individuals living in states with more discriminatory policies against transgender people (e.g., not allowing changes to one's gender identity on official identity papers) exhibited more negative implicit and explicit transgender attitudes. This pattern held after controlling for participant race and gender, as well as when looking only at cisgender participants. These findings extend prior work concerning how intergroup biases relate to regional characteristics such as legislation and do so in a novel and consequential context. This research also informs ongoing work concerning the role of policy-making and social norms on the development and expression of intergroup prejudice.",2023,12,28
Test-Time Training for Deep MS/MS Spectrum Prediction Improves Peptide Identification.,"In bottom-up proteomics, peptide-spectrum matching is critical for peptide and protein identification. Recently, deep learning models have been used to predict tandem mass spectra of peptides, enabling the calculation of similarity scores between the predicted and experimental spectra for peptide-spectrum matching. These models follow the supervised learning paradigm, which trains a general model using paired peptides and spectra from standard data sets and directly employs the model on experimental data. However, this approach can lead to inaccurate predictions due to differences between the training data and the experimental data, such as sample types, enzyme specificity, and instrument calibration. To tackle this problem, we developed a test-time training paradigm that adapts the pretrained model to generate experimental data-specific models, namely, PepT3. PepT3 yields a 10-40% increase in peptide identification depending on the variability in training and experimental data. Intriguingly, when applied to a patient-derived immunopeptidomic sample, PepT3 increases the identification of tumor-specific immunopeptide candidates by 60%. Two-thirds of the newly identified candidates are predicted to bind to the patient's human leukocyte antigen isoforms. To facilitate access of the model and all the results, we have archived all the intermediate files in Zenodo.org with identifier 8231084.",2023,12,28

Prognostic Factors in Pediatric Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma: SEER Analysis of 277 Cases.,"Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is a rare but highly aggressive cancer predominantly affecting children and adolescents. This study explores prognostic factors for pediatric and adolescent ARMS, using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Leveraging SEER data (2000-2019), we analyzed 277 cases. Employing Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models, we identified significant prognostic factors. Gender distribution was nearly equal (56.0% boys, 44.0% girls), with the majority (70.8%) from the white ethnic group. Primary tumors were predominantly in extremities (37.2%). Distant metastases significantly increased mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR], 3.13; 95% CI: 2.14-4.58) and regional lymph node involvement raised mortality risk (HR, 1.36; 95% CI: 0.96-1.92).

The Zn Vacancy-Mediated De-Accumulation Based Process for Hydrogen Production Performance Promotion of 1D Zn─Cd─S Nanorods.,"Due to their anisotropy, 1D semiconductor nanorod-based materials have attracted much attention in the process of hydrogen production by solar energy. Nevertheless, the rational design of 1D heterojunction materials and the modulation of photo-generated electron-hole transfer paths remain a challenge. Herein, a Zn<sub>x</sub> Cd<sub>1-x</sub> S@ZnS/MoS<sub>2</sub> core-shell nanorod heterojunction is precisely constructed via in situ growth of discontinuous ZnS shell and MoS<sub>2</sub> NCs on the Zn─Cd─S nanorods. Among them, the Zn vacancy in the ZnS shell builds the defect level, and the nanoroelded MoS<sub>2</sub> builds the electron transport site. The optimized photocatalyst shows significant photocatalytic activity without Platinum as an auxiliary catalyst, mainly due to the new interfacial charge transfer channel constructed by the shell vacancy level, the vertical separation and the de-accumulation process of photo-generated electrons and photo-generated holes. At the same time, spectral analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations fully prove that shortening difference of speed between the photogenerated electron and hole movement process is another key factor to enhance the photocatalytic performance. This study provides a new path for the kinetic design of enhanced carrier density by shortening the carrier retention time of 1D heterojunction photocatalysts with improved photocatalytic performance.",2023,12,28
Analysis of the penetration of NaOCl 5.25% into dentinal tubules using different irrigation protocols: An ex vivo study.,"The objective of the study was to investigate the 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) penetration into the dentinal tubules after different irrigation methods. Seventy canines were stained with 1% crystal violet and divided into groups (n = 20): GEC-EasyClean; GPUI-E1 Irrisonic ultrasonic insert; GXP-XP-Endo finisher; GPC-conventional irrigation and GNC-stained tooth without irrigation. Axial sections (16×) were assessed and irrigant penetration was quantified as a bleaching halo on the surface of the apical, middle and coronal third. In the apical third, GPUI promoted greater NaOCl penetration (p < 0.05). GXP was better than GEC (p < 0.05), as was GPC (p > 0.05). The GPUI and GXP groups were similar in the middle and coronal third (p > 0.05). GPUI and GXP showed better results than GEC (p < 0.05). GPUI was more effective in the apical third and like GXP in the cervical and middle third.",2023,12,28
The Effect of Ni Doping on FeOF Cathode Material for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries.,"Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage systems due to the abundance and low price of sodium. Until recently, the low theoretical capacities of intercalation-type cathodes less than 250 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> have limited the energy density of SIBs. On the other hand, iron oxyfluoride (FeOF) has a high theoretical capacity of ≈885 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> as a conversion-type cathode material for SIBs. However, FeOF suffers from poor cycling stability, rate capability, and low initial Coulombic efficiency caused by its low electrical conductivity and slow ionic diffusion kinetics. To solve these problems, doping aliovalent Ni<sup>2+</sup> on FeOF electrodes is attempted to improve the electronic conductivity without using a carbon matrix. The ionic conductivity of FeOF is also enhanced due to the formation of oxygen defects in the FeOF crystal structure. The FeOF-Ni1 electrode shows an excellent cycling performance with a reversible discharge capacity of 450.4 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 100 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> after 100 cycles with a fading rate of 0.20% per cycle. In addition, the FeOF-Ni1//hard carbon full cell exhibited a high energy density of 876.9 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> <sub>cathode</sub> with a good cycling stability.",2023,12,28

Water-Triggered Self-Healing of Ti<sub>3</sub> C<sub>2</sub> T<sub>x</sub> MXene Standalone Electrodes: Systematic Examination of Factors Affecting the Healing Process.,"MXenes, with their remarkable attributes, stand at the forefront of diverse applications. However, the challenge remains in sustaining their performance, especially concerning Ti<sub>3</sub> C<sub>2</sub> T<sub>x</sub> MXene electrodes. Current self-healing techniques, although promising, often rely heavily on adjacent organic materials. This study illuminates a pioneering water-initiated self-healing mechanism tailored specifically for standalone MXene electrodes. Here, both water and select organic solvents seamlessly mend impaired regions. Comprehensive evaluations around solvent types, thermal conditions, and substrate nuances underline water's unmatched healing efficacy, attributed to its innate ability to forge enduring hydrogen bonds with MXenes. Optimal healing environments range from ambient conditions to a modest 50 °C. Notably, on substrates rich in hydroxyl groups, the healing efficiency remains consistently high. The proposed healing mechanism encompasses hydrogen bonding formation, capillary action-induced expansion of interlayer spacing, solvent lubrication, Gibbs free energy minimizing MXene nanosheet rearrangement, and solvent evaporation-triggered MXene layer recombination. MXenes' resilience is further showcased by their electrical revival from profound damages, culminating in the crafting of Joule-heated circuits and heaters.",2023,12,28
Modeling the Drug delivery Lifecycle of PLG Nanoparticles Using Intravital Microscopy.,"Polylactide-co-glycolide (PLG) nanoparticles hold immense promise for cancer therapy due to their enhanced efficacy and biodegradable matrix structure. Understanding their interactions with blood cells and subsequent biodistribution kinetics is crucial for optimizing their therapeutic potential. In this study, three doxorubicin-loaded PLG nanoparticle systems are synthesized and characterized, analyzing their size, zeta potential, morphology, and in vitro release behavior. Employing intravital microscopy in 4T1-tumor-bearing mice, real-time blood and tumor distribution kinetics are investigated. A mechanistic pharmacokinetic model is used to analyze biodistribution kinetics. Additionally, flow cytometry is utilized to identify cells involved in nanoparticle hitchhiking. Following intravenous injection, PLG nanoparticles exhibit an initial burst release (<1 min) and rapidly adsorb to blood cells (<5 min), hindering extravasation. Agglomeration leads to the clearance of one carrier species within 3 min. In stable dispersions, drug release rather than extravasation remains the dominant pathway for drug elimination from circulation. This comprehensive investigation provides valuable insights into the interplay between competing kinetics that influence the lifecycle of PLG nanoparticles post-injection. The findings advance the understanding of nanoparticle behavior and lay the foundation for improved cancer therapy strategies using nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems.",2023,12,28
Flexible Nanogenerators Based on Enhanced Flexoelectricity in Mn<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> Membranes.,"Atomically thin, few-layered membranes of oxides show unique physical and chemical properties compared to their bulk forms. Manganese oxide (Mn<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> ) membranes are exfoliated from the naturally occurring mineral Hausmannite and used to make flexible, high-performance nanogenerators (NGs). An enhanced power density in the membrane NG is observed with the best-performing device showing a power density of 7.99 mW m<sup>-2</sup> compared to 1.04 µW m<sup>-2</sup> in bulk Mn<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> . A sensitivity of 108 mV kPa<sup>-1</sup> for applied forces <10 N in the membrane NG is observed. The improved performance of these NGs is attributed to enhanced flexoelectric response in a few layers of Mn<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> . Using first-principles calculations, the flexoelectric coefficients of monolayer and bilayer Mn<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> are found to be 50-100 times larger than other 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Using a model based on classical beam theory, an increasing activation of the bending mode with decreasing thickness of the oxide membranes is observed, which in turn leads to a large flexoelectric response. As a proof-of-concept, flexible NGs using exfoliated Mn<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> membranes are made and used in self-powered paper-based devices. This research paves the way for the exploration of few-layered membranes of other centrosymmetric oxides for application as energy harvesters.",2023,12,28
Ion-Molecule Co-Confining Ammonium Vanadate Cathode for High-Performance Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries.,"Vanadium-based cathode materials have attracted great attention in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). However, the inferior ion transport and cyclic stability due to the strong Coulomb interaction between Zn<sup>2+</sup> and the lattice limit their further application. In this work, CO<sub>2</sub> molecules are in situ embedded in the interlayer structure of NH<sub>4</sub> V<sub>4</sub> O<sub>10</sub> by decomposing excess H<sub>2</sub> C<sub>2</sub> O<sub>4</sub> ·2H<sub>2</sub> O in the main framework, obtaining an ion-molecule co-confining NH<sub>4</sub> V<sub>4</sub> O<sub>10</sub> for AZIB cathode material. The introduced CO<sub>2</sub> molecules expanded the interlayer spacing of NH<sub>4</sub> V<sub>4</sub> O<sub>10</sub> , broadened the diffusion channel of Zn<sup>2+</sup> , and stabilized the structure of NH<sub>4</sub> V<sub>4</sub> O<sub>10</sub> as the interlayer pillars together with <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <semantics><msubsup><mi>NH</mi> <mn>4</mn> <mo>+</mo></msubsup> <annotation>${\mathrm{NH}}_4^ + $</annotation></semantics> </math> , which effectively improved the Zn<sup>2+</sup> diffusion kinetics and cycle stability of the electrode.

NVO-CO<sub>2</sub> -0.8 exhibited excellent specific capacity (451.1 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 2 A g<sup>-1</sup> ), cycle stability (214.0 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 10 A g<sup>-1</sup> after 1000 cycles) and rate performance. This work provides new ideas and approaches for optimizing vanadium-based materials with high-performance AZIBs.",2023,12,28
Large-Scale Vertically Interconnected Complementary Field-Effect Transistors Based on Thermal Evaporation.,"With the rapid development of integrated circuits, there is an increasing need to boost transistor density. In addition to shrinking the device size to the atomic scale, vertically stacked interlayer interconnection technology is also an effective solution. However, realizing large-scale vertically interconnected complementary field-effect transistors (CFETs) has never been easy. Currently-used semiconductor channel synthesis and doping technologies often suffer from complex fabrication processes, poor vertical integration, low device yield, and inability to large-scale production. Here, a method to prepare large-scale vertically interconnected CFETs based on a thermal evaporation process is reported. Thermally-evaporated etching-free Te and Bi<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub> serve as p-type and n-type semiconductor channels and exhibit FET on-off ratios of 10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> , respectively. The vertically interconnected CFET inverter exhibits a clear switching behavior with a voltage gain of 17 at a 4 V supply voltage and a device yield of 100%. Based on the ability of thermal evaporation to prepare large-scale uniform semiconductor channels on arbitrary surfaces, repeated upward manufacturing can realize multi-level interlayer interconnection integrated circuits.",2023,12,28

Optimization of phytase production by <i>Penicillium oxalicum</i> in solid-state fermentation for potential as a feed additive.,"The study aims to statistically optimize the phytase production by <i>Penicillium oxalicum</i> PBG30 in solid-state fermentation using wheat bran as substrate. Variables viz. pH, incubation days, MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and Tween-80 were the significant parameters identified through the Plackett-Burman design (PBD) that majorly influenced the phytase production. Further, central composite design (CCD) method of response surface methodology (RSM) defined the optimum values for these factors i.e., pH 7.0, 5 days of incubation, 0.75% of MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 3.5% of Tween-80 that leads to maximum phytase production of 475.42 U/g DMR. Phytase production was also sustainable in flasks and trays of different sizes with phytase levels ranging from 394.95 to 475.42 U/g DMR. Enhancement in phytase production is 5.6-fold as compared to unoptimized conditions. The <i>in-vitro</i> dephytinization of feed showed an amelioration in the nutritive value by releasing inorganic phosphate and other nutrients in a time-dependent manner. The highest amount of inorganic phosphate (33.986 mg/g feed), reducing sugar (134.4 mg/g feed), and soluble protein (115.52 mg/g feed) was achieved at 37 °C with 200 U of phytase in 0.5 g feed for 48 h. This study reports the economical and large-scale production of phytase with applicability in enhancing feed nutrition.",2023,12,28
"Ligand Control of Copper-Mediated Cycloadditions of Acetylene to Azides: Chemo- and Regio-Selective Formation of Deutero- and Iodo-Substituted 1,2,3-Triazoles.","The participation of σ-monocopper and σ-bis-copper acetylide in mechanistic pathways for copper-catalyzed cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions of acetylene with azides was probed by analysis of deuterium distributions in the 1,2,3-triazole product formed by deuterolysis of initially formed mono- and bis-copper triazoles. The results show that, when Cu(Phen)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> is used as the catalyst for reactions of acetylene with azides in DMF/D<sub>2</sub>O, 1-substituted-5-deutero-1,2,3-triazoles are generated selectively. This finding demonstrates that the Cu(Phen)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>-catalyzed cycloadditions utilize monocopper acetylide as the substrate and produce 5-copper-1,2,3-triazoles initially. Conversely, when DBU or Et<sub>3</sub>N is the copper ligand, the process takes place through initial formation and cycloaddition of bis-copper acetylide to produce 4,5-bis-copper-triazole, which reacts with D<sub>2</sub>O to form the corresponding 4,5-bis-deutero-triazole. Moreover, when C<sub>2</sub>D<sub>2</sub> is used as the substrate, Cu(Phen)(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> as the Cu ligand, and H<sub>2</sub>O/DMF as the solvent, mono-C4-deutreo 1,2,3-triazoles are generated in high yields and excellent levels of regioselectivity. Lastly, CuAAC reactions of acetylene with azides, promoted by CuCl<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O and NaI, yield 4,5-diiodo-1,2,3-triazoles with moderate to high efficiencies.",2023,12,28

How the eyes respond to sounds.,"Eye movements have been extensively studied with respect to visual stimulation. However, we live in a multisensory world, and how the eyes are driven by other senses has been explored much less. Here, we review the evidence on how audition can trigger and drive different eye responses and which cortical and subcortical neural correlates are involved. We provide an overview on how different types of sounds, from simple tones and noise bursts to spatially localized sounds and complex linguistic stimuli, influence saccades, microsaccades, smooth pursuit, pupil dilation, and eye blinks. The reviewed evidence reveals how the auditory system interacts with the oculomotor system, both behaviorally and neurally, and how this differs from visually driven eye responses. Some evidence points to multisensory interaction, and potential multisensory integration, but the underlying computational and neural mechanisms are still unclear. While there are marked differences in how the eyes respond to auditory compared to visual stimuli, many aspects of auditory-evoked eye responses remain underexplored, and we summarize the key open questions for future research.",2023,12,28
TLR3 agonism augments CD47 inhibition in acute myeloid leukemia.,"CD47-SIRPa is a myeloid check point pathway that inhibits phagocytosis of cells lacking markers for self-recognition. Tumor cells can overexpress CD47 and bind to SIRPa on macrophages, preventing phagocytosis. CD47 expression is enhanced and correlated with a negative prognosis in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), with its blockade leading to cell clearance. ALX90 is an engineered fusion protein with high-affinity for CD47. Composed of the N-terminal D1 domain of SIRPα genetically linked to an inactive Fc domain from human IgG, ALX90 is designed to avoid potential toxicity of CD47-expressing red blood cells. Venetoclax (VEN) is a specific B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor that can restore apoptosis in malignant cells. In AML VEN is combined with azanucleosides to induce superior remission rates, however treatment for refractory/relapse is an unmet need. We questioned whether the anti-tumor activity of a VEN based regimen can be augmented through CD47 inhibition (CD47i) in AML. Human AML cell lines were sensitive to ALX90 and its addition increased efficacy of a VEN+AZA regimen in vivo. However, CD47i failed to clear bone marrow tumor burden in PDX models. We hypothesized that in cases of high medullary tumor burden, loss of resident macrophages reduced ALX efficiency. Therefore, we attempted to enhance this medullary macrophage population with agonism of TLR3 via Poly(I:C), which led to expansion and activation of medullary macrophages in in vivo AML PDX models and potentiated CD47i. In summary, the addition of Poly(I:C) can enhance medullary macrophage populations to potentiate the phagocytosis merited by therapeutic inhibition of CD47.",2023,12,28
A novel research competency framework for clinical research nurses and midwives.,"Clinical research nurses and midwives (CRN/Ms) are highly specialised registered nurses. They combine their clinical nursing expertise with research knowledge and skills to aid in the delivery of rigorous, high-quality clinical research to improve health outcomes, the research participant's experience and treatment pathways ( Beer et al 2022 ). However, there is evidence that the transition into a CRN/M role is challenging for registered nurses.",2023,12,28
Strategies to combat heat stress in poultry production-A review.,"The effects of heat stress (HS) caused by high temperatures continue to be a global concern in poultry production. Poultry birds are homoeothermic, however, modern-day chickens are highly susceptible to HS due to their inefficiency in dissipating heat from their body due to the lack of sweat glands. During HS, the heat load is higher than the chickens' ability to regulate it. This can disturb normal physiological functioning, affect metabolism and cause behavioural changes, respiratory alkalosis and immune dysregulation in birds. These adverse effects cause gut dysbiosis and, therefore, reduce nutrient absorption and energy metabolism. This consequently reduces production performances and causes economic losses. Several strategies have been explored to combat the effects of HS. These include environmentally controlled houses, provision of clean cold water, low stocking density, supplementation of appropriate feed additives, dual and restricted feeding regimes, early heat conditioning and genetic selection of poultry lines to produce heat-resistant birds. Despite all these efforts, HS still remains a challenge in the poultry sector. Therefore, there is a need to explore effective strategies to address this long-lasting problem. The most recent strategy to ameliorate HS in poultry is early perinatal programming using the in ovo technology. Such an approach seems particularly justified in broilers because chick embryo development (21 days) equals half of the chickens' posthatch lifespan (42 days). As such, this strategy is expected to be more efficient and cost-effective to mitigate the effects of HS on poultry and improve the performance and health of birds. Therefore, this review discusses the impact of HS on poultry, the advantages and limitations of the different strategies. Finally recommend a promising strategy that could be efficient in ameliorating the adverse effects of HS in poultry.",2023,12,27
Demethylase FTO inhibits the occurrence and development of triple-negative breast cancer by blocking m <sup>6</sup>A-dependent miR-17-5p maturation-induced ZBTB4 depletion.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer, and its mechanisms of occurrence and development remain unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate the role and molecular mechanisms of the demethylase FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein) in TNBC. Through analysis of public databases, we identify that FTO may regulate the maturation of miR-17-5p and subsequently influence the expression of zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 4 (ZBTB4), thereby affecting the occurrence and progression of TNBC. We screen for relevant miRNAs and mRNAs from the GEO and TCGA databases and find that the FTO gene may play a crucial role in TNBC. <i>In vitro</i> cell experiments demonstrate that overexpression of FTO can suppress the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of TNBC cells and can regulate the maturation of miR-17-5p through an m <sup>6</sup>A-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, we establish a xenograft nude mouse model and collect clinical samples to further confirm the role and impact of the FTO/miR-17-5p/ZBTB4 regulatory axis in TNBC. Our findings unveil the potential role of FTO and its underlying molecular mechanisms in TNBC, providing new perspectives and strategies for the research and treatment of TNBC.",2023,12,28
Evaluation of the health-related quality of life in dogs following intracranial meningioma resection using a specifically developed questionnaire.,"As advanced treatments are becoming increasingly feasible in veterinary medicine, the evaluation of the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of treated animals is becoming more relevant. We evaluated owner-perceived HRQOL of 10 dogs that underwent craniotomy for meningioma resection between 2002 and 2022 at our institution through telephone interview. For this purpose, we developed a disease-specific questionnaire containing 52 items (mostly of scoring nature) patterned after previously validated instruments and organised into eight domains. Approval by the Human Ethical Committee and respondents' consent were obtained. We analysed the scores for all domains and dogs. The effect of different variables on the HRQOL score was determined via log-rank test and Pearson correlation. Scores for all included dogs (range, 0-235 points) were totaled, with a higher number of points indicating a better HRQOL. The dogs included in this study yielded a mean score of 200.6 points (range, 176-227 points), implying a good overall quality of life. There were no significant associations between individual parameters and outcomes. Our questionnaire represents a structured tool for the specific evaluation of postoperative HRQOL in dogs with meningioma, placing a minimal burden on respondents. Few instruments have been developed to assess animal welfare in a disease-specific context. Implementing these tools, however, is essential to accurately evaluate not only the impact of treatments on biologic parameters, but also their implications on patient welfare. Thus, treatment plans may consider HRQOL for a more comprehensive clinical decision-making process.",2023,12,27

Biomechanical effects of different loads and constraints on finite element modeling of the humerus.,"Currently, there is no established finite element (FE) method to apply physiologically realistic loads and constraints to the humerus. This FE study showed that 2 'simple' methods involving direct head loads, no head constraints, and rigid elbow or mid-length constraints created excessive stresses and bending. However, 2 'intermediate' methods involving direct head loads, but flexible head and elbow constraints, produced lower stresses and bending. Also, 2 'complex' methods involving muscles to generate head loads, plus flexible head and elbow constraints, generated the lowest stresses and moderate bending. This has implications for FE modeling research on intact and implanted humeri.",2023,12,27

Selective Photoelectrochemical Oxidation of Glycerol to Glyceric Acid on (002) Facets Exposed WO3 Nanosheets.,"Glycerol is a byproduct of biodiesel production. Selective photoelectrochemical oxidation of glycerol to high value-added chemicals offers an economical and sustainable approach to transform renewable feedstock as well as store green energy at the same time. In this work, we synthesized monoclinic WO3 nanosheets with exposed (002) facets, which could selectively oxidize glycerol to glyceric acid (GLYA) with a photocurrent density of 1.7 mA·cm-2, a 73% GLYA selectivity and a 39% GLYA Faradaic efficiency at 0.9 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW·cm-2). Compared to (200) facets exposed WO3, a combination of experiments and theoretical calculations indicates that the superior performance of selective glycerol oxidation mainly originates from the better charge separation and prolonged carrier lifetime resulted from the plenty of surface trapping states, lower energy barrier of the glycerol-to-GLYA reaction pathway, more abundant active sites and stronger oxidative ability of photogenerated holes on the (002) facets exposed WO3. Our findings show great potential to significantly contribute to the sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical processes via designing high performance photoelectrochemical cell via facet engineering for renewable feedstock transformation.",2023,12,27
What is impacting clinical pharmacists' participation in an interprofessional ward round: a thematic analysis of a national survey.,"The ward round (WR) is an important opportunity for interprofessional interaction and communication enabling optimal patient care. Pharmacists' participation in the interprofessional WR can reduce adverse drug events and improve medication appropriateness and communication. WR participation by clinical pharmacists in Australia is currently limited. This study aims to explore what is impacting clinical pharmacists' participation in WRs in Australian hospitals. A self-administered, anonymous national survey of Australian clinical pharmacists was conducted. This study describes the outcomes from qualitative questions which were analyzed thematically in NVivo-2020 according to Braun and Clarke's techniques. Five themes were constructed: ""Clinical pharmacy service structure"", ""Ward round structure"", ""Pharmacist's capabilities"", ""Culture"" and ""Value"". A culture supportive of pharmacist's contribution with a consistent WR structure and flexible delivery of clinical pharmacy services enabled pharmacists' participation in WR. Being physically ""absent"" from the WR due to workload, workflow, and self-perception of the need for extensive clinical knowledge can limit opportunities for pharmacists to proactively contribute to medicines decision-making with physicians to improve patient care outcomes. Bidirectional communication between the interprofessional team and the pharmacist, where there is a co-construction of each individual's role in the WR facilitates consistent and inter-dependent collaborations for effective medication management.",2023,12,27

Modeling large-scale bioreactors with diffusion equations. Part I: Predicting axial dispersion coefficient and mixing times.,"Bioreactor scale-up is complicated by dynamic interactions between mixing, reaction, mass transfer, and biological phenomena, the effects of which are usually predicted with simple correlations or case-specific simulations. This two-part study investigated whether axial diffusion equations could be used to calculate mixing times and to model and characterize large-scale stirred bioreactors in a general and predictive manner without fitting the dispersion coefficient. In this first part, a resistances-in-series model analogous to basic heat transfer theory was developed to estimate the dispersion coefficient such that only available hydrodynamic numbers and literature data were needed in calculations. For model validation, over 800 previously published experimentally determined mixing times were predicted with the transient axial diffusion equation. The collected data covered reactor sizes up to 160 m<sup>3</sup> , single- and multi-impeller configurations with diverse impeller types, aerated and non-aerated operation in turbulent and transition flow regimes, and various mixing time quantification methods. The model performed excellently for typical multi-impeller configurations as long as flooding conditions were avoided. Mixing times for single-impeller and few nonstandard bioreactors were not predicted equally well. The transient diffusion equation together with the developed transfer resistance analogy proved to be a convenient and predictive model of mixing in typical large-scale bioreactors.",2023,12,27
A meta-analysis examining the impact of intrawound treatment on reducing deep surgical site infections during instrumented spine surgery.,"The purpose of the meta-analysis was to evaluate and compare the effect of intrawound management on decreasing deep surgical site infections (SSIs) in instrumented spinal surgery (SS). The results of this meta-analysis were analysed, and the odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using dichotomous or contentious random or fixed effect models. For the current meta-analysis, 29 examinations spanning from 2006 to 2022 were included, encompassing 11 181 people who had instrumented SS. Intrawound management had a significantly lower deep SSI when using vancomycin (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.25-0.44, p < 0.001) and povidone-iodine as intrawound management (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.13-0.42, p < 0.001) compared to control in instrumented SS subjects. The data that was looked at showed that using vancomycin and povidone-iodine as intrawound management had a much lower deep SSI than using a control group of instrumented SS subjects. However, given that some studies included a small number of subjects, attention should be given to their values.",2023,12,27

The knowledge and attitude on the prevention of pressure ulcers in Chinese nurses: A cross-sectional study in 93 tertiary and secondary hospitals.,"Although pressure ulcers are related to substantial health burdens, they may be preventable. Since nurses play a fundamental role in pressure ulcer prevention, their knowledge and attitude are of great importance. This study aims to investigate the current situation and associated factors of nurses' knowledge and attitude on the prevention of pressure ulcers from both tertiary and secondary hospitals. A total of 11 347 nurses were recruited including 7108 nurses (62.6%) from tertiary hospitals and 4239 nurses (37.4%) from secondary hospitals. The median (interquartile range) of the pressure ulcer knowledge score was 51% (38%, 90%) for all the participants with the lowest scores on prevention of pressure ulcers (51.33%). The mean (standard deviation) of attitude towards pressure ulcer prevention was 39.64 (4.65) with the lowest scores on personal competency to prevent pressure ulcers (mean 3.09). The results of multivariate linear regression showed that hospital level, nurses' age, years of work experience, initial education level at work and time of last training significantly associated with nurses' knowledge of pressure ulcer prevention. Meanwhile, hospital level, job title, previous training, time of last training and subjective needs for further training had significant association with nurses' attitude towards pressure ulcer prevention (all p < 0.05). Results showed inadequate knowledge but relative positive attitudes in nurses indicating the importance to deliver continuing education and training regarding pressure ulcer prevention in practice to improve the quality of care.",2023,12,27
The effects of Garcinia cambogia (hydroxycitric acid) on lipid profile: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Garcinia cambogia (GC) has antioxidant, anticancer, antihistamine, and antimicrobial properties. To determine the effect of GC on lipid profiles, a systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out. Up to February 9, 2023, six electronic databases (Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar) were searched at any time without limitations. Trials examining the impact of GC on serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in adults were included. The total effect was shown as a weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) in a random-effects meta-analysis approach. This systematic review and meta-analysis included 14 trials involving 623 subjects. Plasma levels of TC (WMD: -6.76 mg/dL; CI: -12.39 to -0.59, p-value = 0.032), and TG (WMD: -24.21 mg/dL; CI: -37.84 to -10.58, p < 0.001) were significantly reduced after GC use, and plasma HDL-C (WMD: 2.95 mg/dL; CI: 2.01 to 3.89, p < 0.001) levels increased. low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (WMD: -1.15 mg/dL; CI: -16.08 to 13.78, p-value = 0.880) were not significantly affected. The effects of lowering TC and TG were more pronounced for periods longer than 8 weeks. Consuming GC has a positive impact on TC, TG, and HDL-C concentrations. The limitations of this study include the short duration of analyzed interventions and significant heterogeneity. Nevertheless, it is imperative to conduct well-structured, and high-quality long-term trials to comprehensively evaluate the clinical effectiveness of GC on lipid profile, and validate these findings.",2023,12,27
"Neural tracking of continuous acoustics: properties, speech-specificity and open questions.","Human speech is a particularly relevant acoustic stimulus for our species, due to its role of information transmission during communication. Speech is inherently a dynamic signal, and a recent line of research focused on neural activity following the temporal structure of speech. We review findings that characterise neural dynamics in the processing of continuous acoustics and that allow us to compare these dynamics with temporal aspects in human speech. We highlight properties and constraints that both neural and speech dynamics have, suggesting that auditory neural systems are optimised to process human speech. We then discuss the speech-specificity of neural dynamics and their potential mechanistic origins and summarise open questions in the field.",2023,12,27
Analysis of the Screw Accuracy and Postoperative Efficacy of Screw Placement in Single Position and Bipedal Position in Robot-Assisted Oblique Lumbar Interbody Fusion: Preliminary Results of Mazor X Stealth Usage.,"Traditional manual OLIF combined with pedicle screw implantation has many problems of manual percutaneous screw implantation, such as high difficulty of screw placement, many fluoroscopies, long operation time, and many adjustments, resulting in greater trauma. The robot can perform various types of screw placement in the lateral recumbent position, which allows OLIF combined with posterior screw placement surgery to be completed in a single position.

Optimization of a Protocol for Isolating Cell-free DNA from Cerebrospinal Fluid.,"A standardized protocol for the isolation of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is lacking. Therefore, we established a cfDNA isolation protocol optimized for clinical CSF specimens, integrating acceptable modifications and using artificial CSF generated from remnant CSF spiked with reference cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA). We compared the isolation yields of <i>in vitro</i> diagnostic (IVD)-certified column-based (CB) and magnetic bead-based (MB) isolation. Furthermore, we modified both methods, including pre- and post-elution steps. To confirm ctDNA integrity and quantify the variant allele frequency after isolation, we performed droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) targeting <i>IDH1</i> R132C in the reference ctDNA. MB isolation had a higher yield than CB isolation (<i>P</i><0.0001), and post-isolation vacuum increased the final concentration in both methods, with little effect on cfDNA integrity. Our study provides a protocol to maximize CSF-ctDNA concentrations in IVD testing and future studies.",2023,12,28
Study of the influence of nanoscale porosity on the microbial electroactivity between expanded graphite electrodes and Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms.,"Expanded graphite (EG) electrodes gather several advantages for their utilization in microbial electrochemical technologies (MET). Unfortunately, the low microbial electroactivity makes them non-practical for implementing them as electrodes. The objective of this work is to explore the enhancement of microbial electroactivity of expanded graphite (commercial PV15) through the generation of nanopores by CO<sub>2</sub> treatment. The changes in properties were thoroughly analysed by TG, XRD, Raman, XPS, gas adsorption, SEM and AFM, as well as microbial electroactivity in the presence of Geobacter sulfurreducens. Nanopores remarkably enhance the microbially derived electrical current (60-fold increase). Given the inaccessibility of micron-sized bacteria to these nanopores, it is suggested that the electric charge exchanged by electroactive microorganisms might be greatly affected by the capability of the electrode to compensate these charges through ion adsorption. The increased microbial current density produced on activated PV15 opens the possibility of using such materials as promising electrodes in MET.",2023,12,27

A case of tracheal stenosis due to anaplastic thyroid carcinoma treated using the stent-in-stent method.,"Tracheal AERO stent collapse is a rare complication compared to bronchial AERO stent collapse due to differences in the nitinol framework thickness. A 58-year-old man with a bulky anaplastic thyroid carcinoma was referred to our hospital due to exacerbation of tracheal stenosis despite the administration of lenvatinib. His tracheal stenosis exhibited a severe extrinsic compression pattern with a length of 8 cm. Because tracheotomy was inappropriate, we placed an 18 × 80 mm AERO stent. Five months later, he was readmitted with severe dyspnea due to collapse of the distal portion of the stent caused by tumor growth. Because stent removal was difficult, we placed an additional AERO stent (18 × 60 mm) to cover the collapsed portion. The additional stent successfully expanded the collapse and improved his dyspnea. To our knowledge, this is the first case where a tracheal AERO stent collapse due to a poor prognosis tumor was treated with the stent-in-stent method.",2023,12,27

ClpP Peptidase as a Plausible Target for the Discovery of Novel Antibiotics.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to currently available antibiotics/drugs is a global threat. It is desirable to develop new drugs that work through a novel target(s) to avoid drug resistance. This review discusses the potential of the caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) peptidase complex as a novel target for finding novel antibiotics, emphasising the ClpP's structure and function. ClpP contributes to the survival of bacteria via its ability to destroy misfolded or aggregated proteins. In consequence, its inhibition may lead to microbial death. Drugs inhibiting ClpP activity are currently being tested, but no drug against this target has been approved yet. It was demonstrated that Nblocked dipeptides are essential for activating ClpP's proteolytic activity. Hence, compounds mimicking these dipeptides could act as inhibitors of the formation of an active ClpP complex. Drugs, including Bortezomib, Cisplatin, Cefmetazole, and Ixazomib, inhibit ClpP activation. However, they were not approved as drugs against the target because of their high toxicity, likely due to the presence of strong electrophiles in their warheads. The modifications of these warheads could be a good strategy to reduce the toxicity of these molecules. For instance, a boronate warhead was replaced by a chloromethyl ketone, and this new molecule was shown to exhibit selectivity for prokaryotic ClpP. A better understanding of the structure and function of the ClpP complex would benefit the search for compounds mimicking N-blocked dipeptides that would inhibit ClpP complex activity and cause bacterial death.",2023,12,27

Prevalence of psychological and mental health symptoms among nursing professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Americas: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To assess the prevalence of mental health symptoms in nursing professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic on the American continent. A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that estimated the prevalence of mental health symptoms in nursing professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic was performed through bibliographic database searches. A three-level meta-analysis model was used with the inverse variance method, tau was estimated via restricted maximum likelihood and logistic transformation, and heterogeneity was presented as tau<sup>2</sup> and I<sup>2</sup> . Of the 7467 studies obtained, 62 were included in the meta-analysis, which involved 52 270 nursing professionals. The overall prevalence for at least one mental health symptom was 56.3% (50.4%, 62.1%; I<sup>2</sup>  = 98.6%, p < 0.001). Eight mental health symptoms were found; among them, the most prevalent were burnout (52.1%, 37.1%, 88.8%; I<sup>2</sup>  = 98.5%, p < 0.001) and fear (52.1%, 30.1%, 73.3%; I<sup>2</sup>  = 98.1%, p < 0.001). The prevalence of mental health symptoms in nursing professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic on the American continent was high, and strategies should be developed and implemented by managers and government agencies to promote the well-being, physical and mental health of nursing professionals. Studies like this one are necessary to highlight the need for efforts in the implementation of promotion and prevention actions to be developed by health organisations, managers and leaders with a view to improving the quality of life of nursing workers.",2023,12,27
Sarcoma in patients with Lynch syndrome and response to immunotherapy.,"Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant genetic predisposition to multiple malignancies and is characterized by deficient DNA mismatch repair. Increased incidence of sarcomas is not formally ascribed to LS; however, increasing evidence suggests a preponderance of these malignancies in affected families. Sarcomas typically possess a low tumor mutational burden and incite a poor immune infiltrate, thereby rendering them poorly responsive to immunotherapy.",2023,12,27
Combining PTH(1-34) and mechanical loading has increased benefit to tibia bone mechanics in ovariectomised mice.,"Combined treatment with PTH(1-34) and mechanical loading confers increased structural benefits to bone than monotherapies. However, it remains unclear how this longitudinal adaptation affects the bone mechanics. This study quantified the individual and combined longitudinal effects of PTH(1-34) and mechanical loading on the bone stiffness and strengthe evaluated in vivo with validated micro-finite element (microFE) models. C57BL/6 mice were ovariectomised at 14-weeks-old and treated either with injections of PTH(1-34), compressive tibia loading or both interventions concurrently. Right tibiae were in vivo microCT-scanned every two weeks from 14 until 24-weeks-old. MicroCT images were rigidly registered to reference tibia and the cortical organ (whole bone) and tissue-level (midshaft) morphometric properties and bone mineral content were quantified. MicroCT images were converted into voxel-based homogeneous, linear elastic microFE models to estimate the bone stiffness and strength. This approach allowed us for the first time to quantify the longitudinal changes in mechanical properties induced by combined treatments in a model of accelerated bone resorption. Both changes of stiffness and strength were higher with co-treatment than with individual therapies, consistent with increased benefits with the tibia bone mineral content and cortical area - properties strongly associated with the tibia mechanics. The longitudinal data shows thatthe two bone anabolics, both individually and combined, had persistent benefit on estimated mechanical properties, and that benefits (increased stiffness and strength) remained after treatment was withdrawn.

Trends in epidemiology and primary treatment of anal squamous cell carcinoma in the Netherlands (1990-2021).,"A rapid increase in the incidence of anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was reported in several countries over the past decades. This study assessed trends in epidemiology and primary treatment over a 32-year period (1990-2021) using the Netherlands Cancer Registry. The study population included 4273 patients, 44.2% male and 55.8% female (median age 63 years). The age-standardised incidence rate (European Standardised Rate, ESR) increased from 0.5 to 1.6 per 100,000, which entailed an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 5.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.5%-5.8%). While incidence among females increased continuously over the total period (AAPC 4.9%; 95%CI: 4.4%-5.6%), to 1.8 per 100,000 ESR in 2021, incidence among males increased until 2016 (annual percentage change [APC] of 6.3%; 95%CI: 5.6%-10.7%), after which it seemed to stabilise (APC -2.1%; 95%CI: -16.8%-4.5%). Significant trends were also observed in distribution of age, tumour stage and primary treatment modalities. Five-year relative survival (RS) was estimated using the Pohar-Perme estimator, and this improved from 56.1% in 1990-1997 (95%CI: 49.3%-62.4%) to 67.9% in 2014-2021 (95%CI: 64.7%-70.9%), but remained poor for stage IV disease. Evaluation through a multivariable Poisson regression model demonstrated diagnosis in the most recent period to be independently associated with better RS, in addition to female sex, younger age, early disease stage and any treatment. In conclusion, the rising incidence of anal SCC seems to decline in males, but not in females, and advances in diagnostics and therapeutic management have likely contributed to improved prognosis.",2023,12,27

Environmental processes and health implications potentially mediated by dust-borne bacteria.,"Understanding microbial migration and survival mechanisms in dust events (DEs) can elucidate genetic and metabolic exchange between environments and help predict the atmospheric pathways of ecological and health-related microbial stressors. Dust-borne microbial communities have been previously characterized, but the impact and interactions between potentially active bacteria within transported communities remain limited. Here, we analysed samples collected during DEs in Israel, using amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes and transcripts. Different air trajectories and wind speeds were associated not only with the genomic microbial community composition variations but also with specific 16S rRNA bacterial transcripts. Potentially active dust-borne bacteria exhibited positive interactions, including carbon and nitrogen cycling, biotransformation of heavy metals, degradation of organic compounds, biofilm formation, and the presence of pathogenic taxa. This study provides insights into the potential interactive relationships and survival strategies of microorganisms within the extreme dust environment.",2023,12,27

Factors affecting depression in adolescents with increased suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"This study examines factors influencing depression in adolescents with increased suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on an ecological model and using data from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey, 2018. We selected adolescents whose suicidal ideation increased between the third and fourth years of the pandemic and who identified their parents as their guardians. Factors related to depression in adolescents were analyzed using stepwise multiple regression, while considering personal and environmental characteristics in the family and school domains. All models were significant, and Model 3 explained 26.8% of the variance. In Model 3, personal characteristics-physical activity, sleep quality on school days, and smartphone dependence-affected adolescents' depression. Parents' life satisfaction and a rejective childrearing attitude were also found to be significant factors affecting adolescents' depression, along with school life satisfaction and school type. Our findings can inform evidence-based nursing interventions to reduce depression in adolescents with increased suicidal ideation. They can also contribute to building strategies to promote mental health in schools after the pandemic, forming healthy life habits, and laying the foundation for lifelong health.",2023,12,27

Conventional Tregs in treatment-naïve rheumatoid arthritis are deficient in suppressive function with an increase in percentage of CXCR3 and CCR6 expressing Tregs.,"In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), immune homeostasis is maintained by T regulatory cells (Tregs) that in an inflammatory milieu can change towards T-helper-like phenotypes (Th-like Tregs). Our aim was to examine the phenotypic and functional characteristics of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>lo/-</sup> Tregs, Th-like Tregs and T effector (Teff) cells in the peripheral blood (PB) and synovial fluid (SF) of treatment-naïve early RA, as compared to osteoarthritis (OA) and healthy control (HC) peripheral blood. Frequencies of Tregs, CXCR3, CCR6 expressing Tregs (Th-like Tregs), and Teff cells were analyzed using flow cytometry in RA (n = 80), OA (n = 20), and HC (n = 40). Cytokine concentrations of the respective T cell subsets in plasma and SF were measured using flow cytometric bead array. Tregs sorted from RA and HC PB using magnetic beads were analyzed for functional capacities by CFSE proliferation assay and FOXP3 gene expression using real-time PCR. We observed that the frequencies of Th17 cells in PB and SF were significantly higher in RA when compared to HC, whereas Tregs were lower in PB and high in SF compared to HC and OA respectively. Th1- and Th17-related pro-inflammatory cytokines IL12p70, INF-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6, and IL-17A were significantly higher in the plasma and SF of RA. Tregs expressing CXCR3 (Th1-like Tregs) and CCR6 (Th17-like Treg) were significantly higher in PB and SF of RA compared to controls and was positively associated with seropositivity and disease activity. Treg cells isolated from peripheral blood of RA showed decreased function and reduced FOXP3 gene expression compared to HC. In our study, we have demonstrated higher frequencies of Th1 and Th17 cells and increased circulatory and SF pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL12P70, INF-γ, IL-6, IL-17A, and TNF-α) in RA. This inflammatory milieu might alter total Tregs frequencies and influence conversion of Tregs into Th-like Tregs.",2023,12,27
Deep learning algorithms applied to computational chemistry.,"Recently, there has been a significant increase in the use of deep learning techniques in the molecular sciences, which have shown high performance on datasets and the ability to generalize across data. However, no model has achieved perfect performance in solving all problems, and the pros and cons of each approach remain unclear to those new to the field. Therefore, this paper aims to review deep learning algorithms that have been applied to solve molecular challenges in computational chemistry. We proposed a comprehensive categorization that encompasses two primary approaches; conventional deep learning and geometric deep learning models. This classification takes into account the distinct techniques employed by the algorithms within each approach. We present an up-to-date analysis of these algorithms, emphasizing their key features and open issues. This includes details of input descriptors, datasets used, open-source code availability, task solutions, and actual research applications, focusing on general applications rather than specific ones such as drug discovery. Furthermore, our report discusses trends and future directions in molecular algorithm design, including the input descriptors used for each deep learning model, GPU usage, training and forward processing time, model parameters, the most commonly used datasets, libraries, and optimization schemes. This information aids in identifying the most suitable algorithms for a given task. It also serves as a reference for the datasets and input data frequently used for each algorithm technique. In addition, it provides insights into the benefits and open issues of each technique, and supports the development of novel computational chemistry systems.",2023,12,27

Longitudinal relationship between oppositional defiant disorder symptoms and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms in Chinese children: insights from cross-lagged panel network analyses.,"Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are two of the most common childhood mental disorders, and they have substantial comorbidity. The developmental precursor model has long been widely used to explain the mechanisms of comorbidity between ODD and ADHD, however whether it is equally effective at the symptomatic level is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to (a) examine the stability of the ODD and ADHD comorbidity network in a longitudinal sample of high-risk children in China; and (b) examine the longitudinal relationship between the ODD and ADHD symptom networks based on a developmental precursor model. Two hundred sixty-three Chinese children aged 6 to 13 years with ODD and/or ADHD were assessed for symptoms of ODD and ADHD in two surveys conducted 1 year apart. We used data from these two time points to construct two cross-sectional networks and a cross-lagged panel network (CLPN) to explore the symptom network for comorbidity of ODD and ADHD. The analysis shows that: (1) the two cross-sectional networks are highly similar in terms of structure, existence of edges, centrality estimates, and the invariance test shows that there is no significant difference between them. The symptoms ""follow through"", ""interrupts/intrudes"", ""difficulty playing quietly"" and ""concentration"" had the highest expected influence centrality at both time points. (2) Combined with the results of the cross-sectional and cross-lagged networks, we found that ""annoy"" and ""blame"" are potential bridge symptoms between the ODD and ADHD symptom networks. The symptom ""annoy"" forms a reciprocal predictive relationship with ""interrupts/intrudes"", while ""blame"" unidirectionally predicts ""close attention"". In addition, we found that ""vindictive"" predicted numerous ADHD symptoms, whereas ""angry"" was predicted by numerous ADHD symptoms. The findings emphasize the broad predictive relationship between ODD and ADHD symptoms with each other, and that ODD symptoms may lead to activation of the ADHD symptom network and vice versa. These findings suggest that the developmental precursor model at the symptom level may partially explain the comorbidity mechanisms of ODD and ADHD, and future studies should further investigate the underlying multiple mechanisms.",2023,12,27
Adhesive small bowel obstruction: predictive factors of laparoscopic failure.,"The adoption of laparoscopy for the management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) patients is debated. The laparoscopic approach has been associated with a considerable conversion-to-open rate. Nonetheless, reliable predictors of conversion are still unclear. The present study aimed to identify factors associated with conversion to open in ASBO patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery. Patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for ASBO and were admitted to our unit between December 2014 and October 2022 were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were categorized into two groups: patients who underwent complete laparoscopy approach (Group 1) and patients converted to open technique (Group 2). Demographic, clinical, and radiological features, intraoperative findings, and postoperative outcomes were compared. A total of 168 patients were enrolled: 100 patients (59.5%) were included in Group 1, and 68 patients (40.5%) were included in Group 2. The rate of ischemia (p = 0.023), surgical complications (p = 0.001), operative time (p < 0.0001), days of nasogastric tube maintenance (p < 0.0001), time to canalization (p < 0.0001), and length of hospital stay (p < 0.0001) were significantly higher in Group 2 than Group 1. Following univariate analysis, the presence of feces signs (p = 0.044) and high mean radiodensity of intraperitoneal free fluid (p = 0.031) were significantly associated with Group 2 compared with Group 1. Following multivariate analysis, the feces sign was a significant predictive factor of conversion (OR 1.965 [IC 95%]; p = 0.046). Laparoscopic treatment is a safe and effective approach in patients affected by ASBO. The feces sign may be a predictive factor of conversion and could guide the surgeon in selecting the appropriate management of patients affected by ASBO.",2023,12,27
"Listen up, kids! How mind wandering affects immediate and delayed memory in children.","Mind wandering occurs when attention becomes disengaged from the here-and-now and directed toward internally generated thoughts; this is often associated with poorer performance on educationally significant tasks. In this study, 8- to 9-year-old children (N = 60) listened to audio stories embedded with intermittent thought probes that were used to determine if participants' thoughts were on or off task. The key objective was to explore the impact of probe-caught mind wandering on both immediate and delayed memory retention. Children reported being off task approximately 24% of the time. Most inattention episodes were classified as task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., 'pure' instances of mind wandering, 9%) or attentional failures due to distractions (9%). Higher frequency of mind wandering was strongly associated with poorer memory recall, and task-unrelated thoughts strongly predicted how well children could recall components of the audio story both immediately after the task and after a 1-week delay. This study is the first to demonstrate the impact of mind wandering on delayed memory retention in children. Results suggest that exploring mind wandering in the foundational years of schooling could provide the necessary empirical foundation for the development of practical interventions geared toward detecting and refocusing lapses of attention in educational contexts.",2023,12,27

Message Framing Strategies to Promote the Uptake of PrEP: Results from Formative Research with Diverse Adult Populations in the United States.,"There are no evidence-based recommendations for communicating about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as part of a broader HIV-prevention messaging approach. To inform future message development related to PrEP uptake, we interviewed 235 individuals across ten locations in the U.S. to explore their understanding and perceptions of draft HIV prevention messages and assess their overall preferences for a broad or PrEP-focused messaging approach. Participants responded favorably to and related to both draft messages. Participants who were not aware of PrEP were more likely to say the broad HIV-prevention message was personally relevant than those aware of PrEP. There were no significant differences in perceived personal relevance for the PrEP-focused message. Qualitative findings suggest that HIV prevention messages should use specific well-defined terms, include links to additional information, and use choice-enhancing language that emphasizes personal agency and frames the call to action as an informed decision among an array of effective prevention options.",2023,12,28
COVID-19 Vaccination and Reproductive Health: a Comprehensive Review for Healthcare Providers.,"With all the current misinformation on social media platforms about the COVID-19 vaccine and its potential effects on fertility, it is essential for healthcare providers to have evidenced-based research to educate their patients, especially those who are trying to conceive, of the risks to mothers and fetuses of being unvaccinated. It is well known that COVID-19 infection puts pregnant women at higher risk of complications, including ICU admission, placentitis, stillbirth, and death. In February of 2021, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) released a statement denying any link between COVID vaccination and infertility. ASRM later confirmed and stated that ""everyone, including pregnant women and those seeking to become pregnant, should get a COVID-19 vaccine"". In this review, we aim to provide a compilation of data that denies any link between vaccination and infertility for healthcare providers to be able to educate their patients based on evidence-based medicine. We also reviewed the effect of COVID-19 virus and vaccination on various parameters and processes that are essential to obtaining a successful pregnancy.",2023,12,27
Oocyte Vitrification Reduces its Capability to Repair Sperm DNA Fragmentation and Impairs Embryonic Development.,"Oocytes play a crucial role in repairing sperm DNA damage, which can affect the next generation; however, certain factors can impair this ability. This study examined whether oocyte vitrification, a widely used method for fertility preservation, negatively affects repair ability. Male DBA/2 mice (n = 28) were injected with 101.60 µmol/100 g body weight of tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) for 14 days to induce sperm DNA damage. Histological changes, sperm functions, and DNA fragmentation were assessed using the TUNEL assay. Cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) of superovulated female DBA/2 mice (n = 28) were vitrified using the Cryotop method. Fresh and vitrified oocytes were then fertilized by tBHP-treated and untreated sperms, and subsequent embryonic development was monitored. Additionally, the expression of Mre11a, Rad51, Brca1, and Xrcc4 was assessed in resulting zygotes and blastocysts using real-time PCR. The sperm tBHP treatment reduced differentiated spermatogenic cells in the testicular tissue, sperm concentration, and motility, while increasing DNA fragmentation (P < 0.05). The fertilization rate was decreased in the tBHP-treated sperm-vitrified oocyte group (P < 0.05), and the two-cell rate diminished in tBHP-treated sperm-fresh and vitrified oocyte groups (P < 0.05). The four-cell to blastocyst rate decreased in the untreated sperm-vitrified oocyte and the tBHP-treated sperm-fresh and vitrified oocyte groups (P < 0.05), and the tBHP-treated sperm-vitrified oocyte groups had the lowest blastocyst rate. In zygotes, Brca1 was upregulated in the tBHP-treated sperm-vitrified oocyte group (P < 0.05). Also, in blastocysts, Rad51, Brca1, and Xrcc4 were significantly upregulated in the untreated sperm-vitrified oocytes group (P < 0.05). Damages to the oocyte due to vitrification can disrupt the repair of sperm DNA fragmentation and consequently impair the embryo development.",2023,12,27
MiR-3074-5p Regulates Trophoblasts Function via EIF2S1/GDF15 Pathway in Recurrent Miscarriage.,"Dysfunction of extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) might cause early pregnancy failure by interfering with embryo implantation and/or placentation. We previously reported that the villus miR-3074-5p expression level was increased, whereas the peripheral level of GDF15, a predict target gene of miR-3074-5p, was decreased in recurrent miscarriages (RM) patients, and miR-3074-5p could enhance apoptosis but reduce invasion of human extravillous trophoblast cells (EVTs). The aim of this study was to further explore roles of miR-3074-5p/GDF15 pathway in regulation of EVTs function. It was validated that GDF15 was not the direct target of miR-3074-5p, whereas EIF2S1, an upstream regulator of GDF15 maturation and secretion, was the direct target of miR-3074-5p. The villus expression levels of GDF15 and EIF2S1 were significantly decreased in RM patients. Knockdown of GDF15 expression presented inhibitory effects on proliferation, migration, and invasion of HTR8/SVneo cells. Up-regulated miR-3074-5p expression led to the significant decreased GDF15 expression in HTR8/SVneo cells, and this effect could be efficiently reversed by the overexpression of EIF2S1. Meanwhile, the suppressive effects of miR-3074-5p on proliferation, migration, and invasion of HTR8/SVneo cells could be intercepted by the treatment of recombinant human GDF15 protein. Collectively, these data suggested that miR-3074-5p could reduce GDF15 production via targeting inhibition of EIF2S1 expression, and the deficiency in GDF15 function might lead to the early pregnancy loss by attenuating proliferation and invasion of EVTs.",2023,12,27
Isopod mouthpart traits respond to a tropical forest recovery gradient.,"Functional trait ecology has the potential to provide generalizable and mechanistic predictions of ecosystem function from data of species distributions and traits. The traits that are selected should both respond to environmental factors and influence ecosystem functioning. Invertebrate mouthpart traits fulfill these criteria, but are seldom collected, lack standardized measurement protocols, and have infrequently been investigated in response to environmental factors. We surveyed isopod species that consume plant detritus, and tree communities in 58 plots across primary and secondary forests in Singapore. We measured body dimensions (body size traits), pereopod and antennae lengths (locomotory traits), dimensions of mandible structures (morphological mouthpart traits), and mechanical advantages generated by mandible shape (mechanical mouthpart traits) for six isopod species found in these plots and investigated if these traits respond to changes in tree community composition, tree diversity, and forest structure. Morphological mouthpart traits responded to a tree compositional gradient reflecting forest recovery degree. Mouthpart features associated with greater consumption of litter (broader but less serrated/rugose lacinia mobilis [an important cutting and chewing structure on the mandible]) were most prevalent in abandoned plantation and young secondary forests containing disturbance-associated tree species. Feeding strategies associated with fungi grazing (narrower and more serrated/rugose lacinia mobilis) were most prevalent in late secondary forests containing later successional tree species. Since morphological mouthpart traits likely also predict consumption and excretion rates of isopods, these traits advance our understanding of environment-trait-ecosystem functioning relationships across contrasting tropical forest plots that vary in composition, disturbance history, and post-disturbance recovery.",2023,12,27
Metabolites and degradation pathways of microbial detoxification of aflatoxins: a review.,"The degradation of aflatoxins using nonpathogenic microbes and their enzymes is emerging as a safe and economical alternative to chemical and physical methods for the detoxification of aflatoxins in food and feeds. Many bacteria and fungi have been identified as aflatoxin degraders. This review is focused on the chemical identification of microbial degradation products and their degradation pathways. The microbial degradations of aflatoxins are initiated by oxidation, hydroxylation, reduction, or elimination reactions mostly catalyzed by various enzymes belonging to the classes of laccase, reductases, and peroxidases. The resulting products with lesser chemical stability further undergo various reactions to form low molecular weight products. Studies on the chemical and biological nature of degraded products of aflatoxins are necessary to ensure the safety of the decontamination process. This review indicated the need for an integrated approach including decontamination studies using culture media and food matrices, proper identification and toxicity profiling of degraded products of aflatoxins, and interactions of microbes and the degradation products with food matrices for developing practical and effective microbial detoxification process.",2023,12,27

Small-molecule inhibition of kinesin KIF18A reveals a mitotic vulnerability enriched in chromosomally unstable cancers.,"Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer, caused by persistent errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis. Aggressive cancers like high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have a high frequency of CIN and TP53 mutations. Here, we show that inhibitors of the KIF18A motor protein activate the mitotic checkpoint and selectively kill chromosomally unstable cancer cells. Sensitivity to KIF18A inhibition is enriched in TP53-mutant HGSOC and TNBC cell lines with CIN features, including in a subset of CCNE1-amplified, CDK4-CDK6-inhibitor-resistant and BRCA1-altered cell line models. Our KIF18A inhibitors have minimal detrimental effects on human bone marrow cells in culture, distinct from other anti-mitotic agents. In mice, inhibition of KIF18A leads to robust anti-cancer effects with tumor regression observed in human HGSOC and TNBC models at well-tolerated doses. Collectively, our results provide a rational therapeutic strategy for selective targeting of CIN cancers via KIF18A inhibition.",2023,12,27

Impact of demographics and comorbid conditions on plasma biomarkers concentrations and their diagnostic accuracy in a memory clinic cohort.,"Plasma biomarkers have emerged as promising tools for identifying amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology. Before implementation in routine clinical practice, confounding factors modifying their concentration beyond neurodegenerative diseases should be identified. We studied the association of a comprehensive list of demographics, comorbidities, medication and laboratory parameters with plasma p-tau181, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) on a prospective memory clinic cohort and studied their impact on diagnostic accuracy for discriminating CSF/amyloid PET-defined Aβ status. Three hundred sixty patients (mean age 66.5 years, 55% females, 53% Aβ positive) were included. Sex, age and Aβ status-adjusted models showed that only estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, standardized β -0.115 [-0.192 to -0.035], p = 0.005) was associated with p-tau181 levels, although with a much smaller effect than Aβ status (0.685 [0.607-0.763], p < 0.001). Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and eGFR significantly modified GFAP concentration. Age, blood volume (BV) and eGFR were associated with NfL levels. p-tau181 predicted Aβ status with 87% sensitivity and specificity with no relevant increase in diagnostic performance by adding any of the confounding factors. Using two cut-offs, plasma p-tau181 could have spared 62% of amyloid-PET/CSF testing. Excluding patients with chronic kidney disease did not change the proposed cut-offs nor the diagnostic performance. In conclusion, in a memory clinic cohort, age, sex, eGFR, BMI, BV and CCI slightly modified plasma p-tau181, GFAP and NfL concentrations but their impact on the diagnostic accuracy of plasma biomarkers for Aβ status discrimination was minimal.",2023,12,27
A Latent Profile Analysis of Greek University Students' Sexting Profiles: Associations with Big Five Personality Traits.,"The aim of this study was to examine the associations between sexting profiles and five factor model (FFM) personality traits among Greek university students. A sample of 2913 participants predominantly aged between 18 and 25 years (M = 22; SD = 3.54; 69.6% females) completed a self-report online questionnaire that measured sexting behaviors and FFM traits. Latent profile analysis identified five distinct profiles which were labeled uninvolved, consensual sexters, non-consensual sexters, unwanted sexters, and highly involved sexters. The different sexting profiles were associated with distinct patterns of FFM trait scores. Specifically, the uninvolved scored higher on agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness than those highly involved in sexting, consensual, non-consensual, and unwanted sexters. Furthermore, those who sent unwanted sexts were more likely to be emotionally unstable than the consensual sexters and those not involved. These findings indicate that sexting behaviors may be related to certain personality traits and emphasize the importance of considering individual differences when studying sexting behaviors. The practical implications of the findings are discussed.",2023,12,27
Detection and analysis of potential landslides based on SBAS-InSAR technology in alpine canyon region.,"The Lancang River flows through the alpine canyon region of southwest China, an area that has experienced frequent geological disasters over the years. Early monitoring of geological hazards is essential for disaster prevention and mitigation. However, traditional ground monitoring techniques are limited by the complex terrain conditions in high-altitude valley regions. In contrast, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology can provide a high-precision, wide-range monitoring of slow rock-slope deformation, making it an effective tool for studying geological hazards. Within the study area, multiple synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the Sentinel-1A satellite were collected, and surface deformation was obtained using the small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR). The results demonstrate that combining ascending and descending orbit images can be successfully applied to landslide monitoring in complex mountainous areas. Over 30 potential landslides were identified by combining InSAR results with optical images. The Line-Of-Sight (LOS) direction deformation features and their relationship with precipitation were analyzed based on two typical landslides, and two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) deformation decomposition was carried out to reveal its motion characteristics. It was found that the cumulative deformation fluctuation amplitude was higher during the rainy season, and the main movement direction of the landslide was east-west. In addition, based on the spatial distribution and statistical analysis of deformation points along with meteorological data, geological elements, human activities, and topographic conditions, it is inferred that factors such as low vegetation coverage, tectonic movements, human activities, and high-altitude glacier thawing may contribute to the occurrence of disasters. And it was found that areas with high vegetation cover, high rainfall, and snow cover exhibit lower coherence coefficients. This study offers valuable insights for investigating large-scale geological in alpine canyon regions.",2023,12,27
Environmental risk of ion-absorbed rare earth ores: concentration of leaching agent and fractionation of Pb.,"Rare earth (RE) is an important strategic resource; however, there has been a growing concern about the environmental problems caused by RE mining, such as ammonia nitrogen pollution and heavy metal pollution. There is a limited research about the behavior of leaching agents and the fractionation of RE and heavy metal during the mining process for ion adsorption of rare earth ore (IRE-ore) in the previously available papers. In this study, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution, which commonly used in the production of mining IRE-ore, was used as a leaching agent. The adsorption behavior of ore soils on ammonium ions was explored by batch experiments. The adsorption process of IRE-ore on ammonium ions followed a pseudo-second-order equation and was controlled by the kinetics of surface adsorption and intra-particle diffusion; the ammonium ion adsorption isotherm conformed to the Freundlich isotherm equilibrium equation, and the higher concentration advantage made the ore soils possess a higher adsorption capacity of ammonium ion. In addition, the fractionation characteristics of lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), and lead (Pb) in the ore soil during the leaching process were simulated based on the batch and column leaching experiments. The results demonstrated that the exchangeable states of La and Ce in IRE-ore were high, and the exchangeable, carbonate-bound La and Ce were almost all leached out by (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> leaching agent, while the most of exchangeable Pb flowed out along with leaching agent, and a small amount of leached Pb in the ore soil was converted to iron and manganese oxide-bound Pb and enriched in the direction of migration of the leaching solution, and when the environment (e.g., pH and Eh) changed, this part of Pb may be re-activated. Our research might serve as crucial baseline knowledge for the adsorption of ammonium ions by ore soils, and provide a data reference for reducing the use of leaching agents and developing sustainable technologies for green mining of ion-adsorption RE ores.",2023,12,27
